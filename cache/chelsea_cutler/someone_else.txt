I know why you're calling
We've been here before
I know what you want
you say I'm the one
Then walk out the door
You spin for a minute
But I can't let go
Don't answer the phone
I swear that I'm fine
No self control, yeah

To change, I do this, I do this, I know
I call you, I call you, you answer the phone
Then in the morning you leave me
Hung out to dry in the city rain

Maybe I need another shadow in the dark
Maybe I'm lonely and I don't know what I want
Maybe it's 4AM but I still call you up every time
'Cause I want you to put me through hell
Maybe I need another shadow in the dark
Maybe I'm lonely and I don't know what I want
Maybe it's 4AM but I still call you up every time
'Cause I'm scared you're with someone else

I know what this is ay
But you won't admit
'Cause it's been three days
And you will not say
That you wanted this
It feels like forever
So tell me it's real
You got me wondering
Would you be down
if I wanted you still

To change, I do this, I do this, I know
I call you, I call you, you answer the phone
Know that we left it to simmer
Can't help but thinking you're with her

Maybe I need another shadow in the dark
Maybe I'm lonely and I don't know what I want
Maybe it's 4AM but I still call you up every time
Cause I want you to put me through hell
Maybe I need another shadow in the dark
Maybe I'm lonely and I don't know what I want
Maybe it's 4AM but I still call you up every time
Cause I'm scared you're with someone else

Maybe I need another shadow in the dark
Maybe I'm lonely and I don't know what I want
Maybe it's 4AM but I still call you up every time
Cause I'm scared you're with someone else
