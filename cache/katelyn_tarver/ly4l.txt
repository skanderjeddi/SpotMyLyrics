I'm anxious, you know this
I'm anxious and erotic, I know
You're just like cold water on my face
You're staple, you're solid
I can never worried about it
We fight, but don't get stuck in a bad place

You and me, we got that kind of love
I mean it
The way you know me like nobody does
I'm serious, you show me the good parts of myself
I promise I wouldn't feel this good with no one else

So you always make it better?
I want this shit forever
Whenever we're together, I wanna stay there all night
All I wanna be is with you, I wanna stay here with you
And I'm not crazy if I say I wanna love you for life
Love you for

That night on your roof
We were dancing, no shoes
I told you my heart's got some damage
Guess that's when I knew
You looked at me, said 'That's cool'
Said 'Baby, that's nothing I can't handle'

You and me, we got that kind of love
I mean it
The way you know me like nobody does
I'm serious, you show me the good parts of myself
I promise I wouldn't feel this good with no one else

So you always make it better?
I want this shit forever
Whenever we're together, I wanna stay there all night
All I wanna be is with you, I wanna stay here with you
And I'm not crazy if I say I wanna love you for life
Wanna love you for
Wanna love you for

You and me, we got that kind of love
I mean it
The way you know me like nobody does
I'm serious, you show me the good parts of myself
I promise I wouldn't feel this good with no one else
No, I wouldn't feel this good

So you always make it better?
I want this shit forever
Whenever we're together, I wanna stay there all night
All I wanna be is with you, I wanna stay here with you
And I'm not crazy if I say I wanna love you for life
So you always make it better?
I want this shit forever
Whenever we're together, I wanna stay there all night
All I wanna be is with you, I wanna stay here with you
And I'm not crazy if I say I wanna love you for life
Wanna love you for
Wanna love you for
Wanna love you for
