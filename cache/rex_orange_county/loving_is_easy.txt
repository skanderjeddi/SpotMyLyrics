Loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

Listen girl
When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, on time

So loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

Oh, oh
Ah, Ah
Oh, oh
Ah, Ah

So listen girl
When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, oh on time

Loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

Oh, oh
Ah, Ah
Oh, oh
Ah, Ah
