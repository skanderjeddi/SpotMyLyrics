She's a sunrise dressed like dusk
Going out, she's getting into something
He's a moth drawn to a flame
He's going in, he's going all or nothing

They look so pretty from afar

Like the gates of heaven are open now
And my one true love has just waltzed right out
Yeah, there's one thing about me that you should know
That I can't help from speaking my mind

There's a dangerous kind of cool about you
But she didn't, no, she didn't know nothing
Now she swims right past his eyes
Where she didn't, no, she didn't find nothing

You look so pretty from afar

Like the gates of heaven are open now
And my one true love has just waltzed right out
Yeah, there's one thing about me that you should know
That I can't help from speaking my mind

Girl, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
With all the time in the world for chasing pretty girls
Yeah, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
I've got no time to waste on another pretty face, oh
I've got no time to waste on another pretty face

There's one thing about me that you should know
That I can't help from speaking my mind
I donâ€™t like you
You look so pretty from afar
I despise you
Why are you so fucking perfect on the outside?

She's a sunrise dressed like dusk
Going out, she's getting into something
He's going all or nothing
I'm saying

Girl, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
With all the time in the world for chasing pretty girls
Yeah, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
I've got no time to waste on another pretty face
Girl, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
With all the time in the world for chasing pretty girls
Yeah, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
I've got no time to waste on another pretty face, oh
I've got no time to waste on another pretty face, oh
I've got no time to waste on another pretty face, oh
