My feet go boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
My heart beats boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
High speed go zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom
My feet go boom boom boom
Walkin' away from you

That's what I'm gonna do
I got the same old shoes
With a new attitude
Why would I sing the blues...
For you?

I said hey, uh-huh, you can't stop me
'Cause my pain, uh-huh, is gasoline (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
I can't wait, no, for nobody
If you break my heart, it's one two three
Boom boom boom

My feet go boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
My heart beats boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
High speed go zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom
My feet go boom boom boom
Walkin' away from you

That's what I'm gonna do
I got a new tattoo
Don't know what to tell you
Got nothin' left to prove to you

I said hey, uh-huh, you can't stop me
'Cause my pain, uh-huh, is gasoline (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
I can't wait, no, for nobody
If you break my heart, it's one two three
Boom boom boom

Hold on
I'm goin', goin', goin', goin', gone
'Cause a big storm
Is comin', comin', comin', comin' on

Hold on
I'm goin', goin', goin', goin', gone
'Cause a big storm
Is comin', comin', comin', comin' on
Comin', comin', comin', comin'
Comin', comin', comin', comin'
Boom boom boom

My feet go boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
My heart beats boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom

My feet go boom boom boom
Walkin' away from you
