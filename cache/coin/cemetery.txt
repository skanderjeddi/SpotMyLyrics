He was born the fall of '58
Made a fortune selling real estate
Golden lions waited at the gate
He was lonely, but it all looked great

Never made time for the family
But he is the richest man in the cemetery
Only made time for the company
But he is the richest man in the cemetery
He is the richest man in the cemetery
But he is the richest man in the cemetery

Cut from diamonds, but he came from dust
Built a kingdom out of salt and blood
Owned a city, never saw the streets
Or the people that he'd never meet

Warm blood, cold heart
Yeah, he's all alone
He had it all, but it couldn't buy love
Yeah, he died alone

Never made time for the family
But he is the richest man in the cemetery
Only made time for the company
But he is the richest man in the cemetery
He is the richest man in the cemetery
But he is the richest man in the cemetery

Never made time for the family
But he is the richest man in the cemetery
Only made time for the company
But he is the richest man in the cemetery
He is the richest man in the cemetery
But he is the richest man in the cemetery
