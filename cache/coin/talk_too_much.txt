Caffeine, small talk
Wait out the plastic weather
Mmhmm, uh uh, discussing current events
I'll take my time
I'm not the forward thinker
You read my mind
Better to leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid?

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much

You know my type
Tightrope across the table
Mmhmm, uh huh, I can't keep holding my breath
New wave, no time
Red velvet under pressure
Blah blah, green eyes
I never leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid?

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much

Silence is golden, and you've got my hopes up
We talk too much
No hesitation, what are we waiting for?
We talk too much

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much
