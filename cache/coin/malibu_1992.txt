I watched you board an airplane
A high dive from the summer's heat wave, down
A bit tongue and a taste of iron
Sweethearts that high school soured, now

Our time had grown to a closing
You moved when you ran out of money to stay
Your parents' house in Ohio
Your old bed replaced with a treadmill, now

Well I come here more than you know
And I'm sure you think I've outgrown you
But I couldn't

Oh, I did it again, I did it again
Oh, I did it again
Oh, I must still want you

Our names carved in the pavement
Sealed by what's left of our hand-prints now
I told my mom, she'd love to meet you
But it's too bad she won't get the chance to

Oh, I did it again, I know I did it again, oh
Oh, I did it again
I must still want you

And I'll not be part to blame
And I'll not be part to blame

You're some old man's new trophy
Locked up in some house in New Jersey
Now money's not a problem
But 20 years it seems you've forgotten
