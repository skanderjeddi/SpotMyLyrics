I can be a handful
But that's why you have two hands
I'm not ever careful
And I can be rude, yeah
You can be a red light stop or run right through
I can be a danger for you

Too many issues, so I wouldn't blame you
Bearer of bad news, I've got no excuse

I talk to myself (self)
I think I need help (help)
So what if I'm na na na not okay?
I'm na na na not okay
I'm bad for my health (health)
My head's on a shelf (shelf)
So what if I'm na na na not okay?
I'm na na na not okay

Drinking on a Monday
Feeling unstable, yeah
You said 'you're doing it the wrong way'
Then you got up on a table
I could be a one night stand you crash into
Wake up on the pavement half past two

Too many issues, so I wouldn't blame you
Bearer of bad news, I've got no excuse

I talk to myself (self)
I think I need help (help)
So what if I'm na na na not okay?
I'm na na na not okay
I'm bad for my health (health)
My head's on a shelf (shelf)
So what if I'm na na na not okay?
I'm na na na not okay

I'm just like everyone else
Fucked up like everyone else
I'm just like everyone else
Fucked up like everyone else

I talk to myself (self)
I think I need help (help)
So what if I'm na na na not okay?
I'm na na na not okay
I'm bad for my health (health)
My head's on a shelf (shelf)
So what if I'm na na na not okay?
I'm na na na not okay

I sing to myself (self)
Who needs to get well (well)
So what if I'm na na na not okay? (I'm not)
I'm na na na not okay
