I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price

We can go to my house if you wanna
Hang out in my bedroom, lose your honor
Even if they find us, we're apathetic
And they can't take that away

I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price

The voices in my right brain are kinda funny
They tell me 'take a deep breath, it's always sunny'
But where I leave the lights on
It's so obvious that my life's pretty plain

I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price

We take strange things to feel normal
We take strange things to feel normal
We take strange things to feel normal
To feel normal, to feel normal

I take my pills and I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I'm happy all the time
I love my girl but she ain't worth the price
She ain't worth the price
No, she ain't worth the price
