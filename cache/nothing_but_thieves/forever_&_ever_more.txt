Down in the gutter and looking for trouble
Or something to that effect
And there she was, a metal cross
Ironically round her neck
And then she kissed me on the lips
And a fever came without a warning

Said give me a holla
And then I will follow you down into the dark
And I was left in the depths
Surrounding her feral heart
Oh there's just something about the sun that seems so very very boring

What did you think when you made me this way?
What did you think when you love me this way?
Hold me so close when we get to the gates
And we'll be together forever and ever and more

If you desire then you be my fire
And I'll be your gasoline
I'm getting sick of all the kicks
This city is selling me
And she said
Hey, let's get away and
I'll be your new religion baby

What did you think when you made me this way?
What did you think when you love me this way?
Hold me so close when we get to the gates
And we'll be together forever and ever and more

(Hold me close)
(Smother me)
(Hold me close)
(Smother me)
(Hold me close)
(Smother me)
(Hold me close)
(Smother me)
(Hold me close)
(Smother me)
(Hold me close)
(Smother me)
(Hold me close)
(Smother me)
(Hold me close)
(Smother me)

Hold me close
My little draculove
Wrap your arms around me
My draculove
My draculove

What did you think when you made me this way?
What did you think when you love me this way?
Hold me so close when we get to the gates
And we'll be together forever and ever and more
