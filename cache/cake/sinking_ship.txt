We are on a sinking ship
We are on a sinking ship

You say we are one
You say we are having fun

You say we are all in the same boat
You say that this thing will float

You say you had your doubts
Sometimes you wanted to get out

Instead you said give this a little more time
And everything is gonna be fine

We are on a sinking ship
We are on a sinking
Sinking
Sinking
Sinking
Sinking ship

And if your people are the best
Tell me why are you wearing a vest
This investigation into disinformation keeps putting everyone to the test

So now we are getting drunk
What was sinking now is sunk
And everything we were just trying to save is now vanishing under the wave

We are on a sinking ship
We are on a sinking
Sinking
Sinking
Sinking
Sinking ship

We are on a sinking ship
Sinking
Sinking

We are on a sinking ship
Sinking
Sinking

We are on a sinking ship
Sinking
Sinking
