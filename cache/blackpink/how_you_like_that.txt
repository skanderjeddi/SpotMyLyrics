보란 듯이 무너졌어
바닥을 뚫고 저 지하까지
옷 끝자락 잡겠다고

다시 캄캄한 이곳에 Light up the sky
니 두 눈을 보며 I'll kiss you goodbye
실컷 비웃어라 꼴좋으니까
이제 너희 하나 둘 셋

[English translation:]

BLACKPINK in your area

I crumbled before your eyes
Hit rock bottom and sunk deeper
To grab onto the last bit of hope
I've tried to reach out with both of my hands

Again in this dark place, light up the sky
While looking into your eyes, I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want while you still can
Because it's about to be your turn 1, 2, 3

Ha how you like that?
You gon' like that that that that that
That that that that
How you like that?
How you like that that that that that
That that that that

Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that
Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that

Your girl need it all and that's a hundred
10 out of 10 I want what's mine
Karma come and get some
I feel bad but there's nothing I can do
Whats up I'm right back
Cock back the trigger
Plain Jane get hijacked
Don't like me? Then tell me how you like that, like that

In this even darker place shine like the stars
With a smile on my face I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want while you still can
Because it's about to be your turn 1, 2, 3

Ha how you like that?
You gon' like that that that that that
That that that that
How you like that?
How you like that that that that that
That that that that

Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that
Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that

The day I fell without my wings
Those dark days where I was trapped
You should've ended me when you had the chance
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane

Bring out your boss bitch
BLACKPINK!
