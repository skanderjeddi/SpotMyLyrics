Накривил е калпачето ей така, па така
Нанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па така
Накривил е калпачето ей така, па така
Нанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па така

I've got a fever, don't breathe on me
I'm a believer of nobody
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't [*sneeze*]
Really we just need to fear something
Only pretending to feel something
I know you're dying to run
I wanna turn you around

Please, remain calm, the end has arrived
We cannot save you, enjoy the ride
This is the moment you've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning, this is a war

It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, eh-eh
Move

I heard they need better signal
Put chip and pins in the needles
Quarantine all of those secrets
In that black hole you call a brain before it's too late
Really we just wanna scream something
Only pretend to believe something
I know you're baying for blood
I wanna turn you around

Please, remain calm, the end has arrived
We cannot save you, enjoy the ride
This is the moment you've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning, this is a war

It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, eh-eh
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will

You can board up your windows, you can lock up your doors, yeah
But you can't keep washing your hands of this shit anymore
When all the king's sources and all the king's friends
Don't know their arses from their pathogens
When life is a prison and death is the door
This ain't a warning, this is a war, war
This is a war, eh-eh, oh-oh

It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, eh-eh

It's the Parasite Eve, eh-eh
It's the Parasite Eve, eh-eh
It's the Parasite Eve, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh

We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you
