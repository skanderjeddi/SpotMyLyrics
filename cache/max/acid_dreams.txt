You look so good in that night gown, girl
Freckles on your face, let me kiss each one
Fingers on your waist, let me tip toe up
Your spine, yeah
You keep it low key with your natural curls
Up in outer space when I make you, girl
Deja vu like we done this once or twice, yeah

You're beautiful
Something like these acid dreams
Acid dreams
You're something I ain't used to, girl
I'm gon' give you everything
Everything

Pop star chick high key boring
Takes my clothes and calls me horny
Takes me close, I think she corny
Get your money, girl don't worry
Says I'm garbage, just ignores me
Wish my shit was more top 40
Wants my commas, wait for karma
Got that ass just like your mama

The way you look tonight
It's like I'm gliding on a day trip
And I feel so alive
It's like my soul just needed a maintenance
Cause the way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
Ahh yeah
I can't believe it's real cause

You're beautiful
Something like these acid dreams
Acid dreams
You're something I ain't used to, girl
I'm gon' give you everything
Everything

You the one
I wanna see you when I wake up
I wanna see you when I wake up
You the one
I wanna see you when I wake up
I wanna see you when I wake up
You the one
I wanna see you when I wake up
I wanna see you when I wake up
(I don't know if it's love, I just think you're attractive)

You're beautiful
Something like these acid dreams
Acid dreams
You're something I ain't used to, girl
I'm gon' give you everything
Everything

You're beautiful
I wanna see you when I wake up
You're something I ain't used to, girl...
