Would you love me less
If you knew the places that I've been
If you knew the damage that I did
Would you love me less
No no no no no no no no no

I've got
Too much dirt to come clean
Closets full of skeletons that you don't wanna see
Will you judge me
All my ugly
I won't blame you if you do
No lies
Don't wanna keep no secrets
Even if what Imma say will you leave speechless
No secrets

If I introduce you to my demons
Tell me baby would you love me less
If you knew the places that I've been
If you knew the damage that I did
Would you love me less
No no no no no no no no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins
If you knew the beds that I've been in
Would you love me less
No no no no no no no no no

I'm happy you never saw me in college
Blood on my hands I refuse to acknowledge
That's why I get light headed
Thin ice that I'm treading
Soft conversations in our bed my skins sweatin'
She doesn't, like my list of exes I've had at home
She's buggin', sounding childish like a xylophone
Knees buckling hearing that falsetto that's in her tone
If I introduce you to my demons tell me baby

Would you love me less
If you knew the places that I've been
If you knew the damage that I did
Would you love me less
No no no no no no no no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins
If you knew the beds that I've been in
Would you love me less
No no no no no no
(Or would you love me more)

Or would you love me more
If you knew the person that I was, yeah
If you knew the power of your love to change me
And if I introduce you to my demons tell me

Baby you won't love me less
If you knew the places that I've been
If you knew the damage that I did (the trouble that I'm in)
Would you love me less
No no no no no no no no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins
If you knew the beds that I've been in
Would you love me less
No no no no no no no no no
