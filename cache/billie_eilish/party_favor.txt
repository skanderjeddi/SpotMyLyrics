Hey, leave a message

Hey, call me back
When you get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what
Maybe just forget it
Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

Stay and blah blah blah
You just want what you can't have
No way, I'll call the cops
If you don't stop I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
It's not you it's me and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don't you, babe
I'm not your party favor

Look, now I know we could've done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read them backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

You hear stay and blah blah blah
You just want what you can't have
No way, I'll call the cops
If you don't stop I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
It's not you it's me and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don't you, babe
I'm not your party favor
