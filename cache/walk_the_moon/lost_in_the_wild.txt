Eyelids split at sunrise
Morning breaks like splatter paint
Wipe the dust from my eyes
You must have left before morning came

Flashes of the night come rushing in
In a stampede of misbehaviors
Just a sophomore running my mouth
I really thought that I could save us

And we'll all be animals
Didn't need to start a forest fire
Brush the ashes off your shoulders
Let's get lost in the wild
We're all built for something
Trying to find a starting line
Don't look over your shoulders

Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild

Something shocks my muscles
Hard rain backends my senses
Now I'm flying fast on my feet
Skipping rivers, clearing them fences
I'm tracking you into the city
Ooh under the pressure of the traffic lights
I'm chasing the clues you left me
That you might still join me in the wild

And we'll all be animals
Didn't need to start a forest fire
Brush the ashes off your shoulders
Let's get lost in the wild
We're all built for something
Trying to find a starting line
Don't look over your shoulders

Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild

Scratches on my hands and feet
You belong out here with me
Tearing up my hands and feet
You belong out here with me
You belong out here with me

I'm flying fast on my feet

And we'll all be animals
Didn't need to start a forest fire
Brush the ashes off your shoulders
Let's get lost in the wild
We're all built for something
Trying to find a starting line
Don't look over your shoulders

Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild

What if nothing went along
What if nothing died young
What if nothing was enough to never give up
Maybe none of this is real
Maybe I can wake up
Maybe then, oh

In my mind
You won't be in my mind, oh
In my mind
You won't be in my mind
In my mind
