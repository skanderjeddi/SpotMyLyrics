Tension is building with drinks
I wanna know what you're thinking
Hoping you're getting the hints
Getting more obvious with them
Who will be making the move
Feels kinda weird when it's you and I, and I

Boom boom boom boom boom, danada
Boom boom boom boom boom, malandra
Boom boom boom boom boom, me arranha
Boom boom boom boom boom, na manha

Our bodies tangled tight
In that purple light
We're making love passed out
We look so damn good tonight
Now Sunday's shining in
Feel the shame coming
You don't belong to me
Are you gonna tell her?

Our bodies tangled tight
In that purple light
We're making love passed out
We look so damn good tonight
Now Sunday's shining in
Feel the shame coming
You don't belong to me
Are you gonna tell her?

Ih fico malucão, malucão
E aí pura tentação quando senta aqui
Nesse jogo de perigo que mexe comigo
Quando tô contigo é tesão não dá pra resistir

Você joga só de sacanagem
Quando chega é cheia de maldade
Lance perigoso é mais gostoso
Nossa pegação é nível hard

Boom boom boom boom boom, danada
Boom boom boom boom boom, malandra
Boom boom boom boom boom, me arranha
Boom boom boom boom boom, na manha

Our bodies tangled tight
In that purple light
We're making love passed out
We look so damn good tonight
Now Sunday's shining in
Feel the shame coming
You don't belong to me
Are you gonna tell her?

Our bodies tangled tight
In that purple light
We're making love passed out
We look so damn good tonight
Now Sunday's shining in
Feel the shame coming
You don't belong to me
Are you gonna tell her?

Are you gonna tell her?
Are you gonna tell her?
Are you gonna tell her?
Are you gonna tell her?
