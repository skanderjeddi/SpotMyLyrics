I'm curious to know who you are
Know what turns you on, turns you off
Know we're not kids anymore
Know we've both been here before
These butterflies scare me to death
Feel them beating out of my chest
Make me come, come so alive
And go with your moves through the night

We've both seen the world
Live and learn
Don't know what you heard
But it, but it can't be worse than I know
We've both seen the world
Live and learn
Don't know what you heard
But it, but it can't be worse than I know

And baby, don't ask, then don't tell
Already know you're fucked up
And it's cool with me
My past and don't ask and don't tell
No need to share too much
Come on, let it be, ah (and baby)

Experienced in more than one way
Whatever I need, you got me
Whisper dirty things that we like
Images stuck on my mind

We've both seen the world
Live and learn
Don't know what you heard
But it, but it can't be worse than I know
We've both seen the world
Live and learn
Don't know what you heard
But it, but it can't be worse than I know

And baby, don't ask, then don't tell
Already know you're fucked up
And it's cool with me
My past and don't ask and don't tell
No need to share too much
Come on, let it be, ah (and baby)

There's nothing I don't wanna know, yeah
And I don't believe in lies
Baby, we're so good together
Does it matter what we hide?

And baby, don't ask, then don't tell
Already know you're fucked up
And it's cool with me
My past and don't ask and don't tell
No need to share too much
Come on, let it be, ah (and baby)
Don't ask, then don't tell
Already know you're fucked up
And it's cool with me
My past and don't ask and don't tell
No need to share too much
Come on, let it be, ah (and baby)
