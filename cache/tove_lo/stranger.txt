Fading out, that's my way of life
Losing high when the beat goes down
Take me now, take me to a place we're alone, we're alone
Fading in, take off all my clothes
Into you, my frustration grows
Take me now, want you to bring me home

You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely, lonely heart
Waiting for someone to take me home
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely, vagabond
Hold me down, want you to bring me home

Let's begin, love making you beg for the win
I'm the prize you get if you do everything I say
Get you high, I get you high
I wanna be what you want me to be
I'd go anywhere, no rules, I don't care
Whoa, just take me home

Oh, my stranger in the dark
I am lonely, lonely heart
Waiting for someone to take me home
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely, lonely heart
Waiting for someone to take me home
(Someone to take me home)
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely, vagabond
Hold me down, want you to bring me home

So you're my last hope and, and I don't care what you do
Leave my heart open, I'm gonna leave it for you
You can walk on it, I wanna hurt, feeling used
Take the edge off it, just take the edge off it
