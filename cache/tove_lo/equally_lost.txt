You see I'm looking lonely waiting for somebody
Waiting for somebody carefree
Hey, wanna get high with me?

I see you looking at me, so I turn my charm on
Hoping you think I look awesome
Wanna feel your hands on me

Gotta play it up, my way, oh oh
Gotta play it up, cause I want you, oh
Wanna run away, run away for the na-night, na-night, night

E, equally lost
With our drunken hearts we'll be dancing more than enough
E, equally lost
Yeah we own the night and our hearts are wild and in love

Used to be so down down, yeah
Now my heart goes dum dum for ya
Used to be so down down, yeah
Now my heart goes dum dum for ya

Come undone with me with the rum, hun
I gotchu with the drinks in abundance
I ain't tryna get to know no one of ya loved ones
Cuz I'm a whole other bitch when I'm fucked up, aye
Tell me what you want, what you into, aye
And I could tell ya raw what ya been thru, aye
And me nah want it soft na a gentle, aye
Just wanna get lost in ya rental, aye

E, equally lost
With our drunken hearts we'll be dancing more than enough
E, equally lost
Yeah we own the night and our hearts are wild and in love

Used to be so down down, yeah
Now my heart goes dum dum for ya
Used to be so down down, yeah
Now my heart goes dum dum for ya
