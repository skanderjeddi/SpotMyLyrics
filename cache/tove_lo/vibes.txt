[Tove Lo:]
Skin to skin
Seepin' in
Flickering, our eyes go wide
You giving me studded sight
Painting stars
In our hearts
Yeah, you know I'm down for you
I want you to lick my wounds

What's you line though?
That I'm fine, oh
Heard that before
But somehow it means more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes, ooh
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, tripping on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you

[Joe Janiak & Tove Lo:]
Break away
All the things stopping me from letting go
Temperature is taking hold
Heart beating faster and faster
I'll be your (you'll be my) brand new disaster
But I don't know
Seems like what you're looking for

[Joe Janiak:]
What's you type, though?
Am I right? No
Heard that before
Still you want it more

[Tove Lo:]
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes, ooh
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, tripping on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you

[Joe Janiak:]
What's you type, though?
Am I right? No
Heard that before
But still you want it more

[Tove Lo & Joe Janiak:]
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes, ooh
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, tripping on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes
Tell me

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
