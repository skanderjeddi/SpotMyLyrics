[Tove Lo:]
First line, take mine; I'm fine as fuck
Love myself tonight and I think you can feel the same
Moonshine, good time; babe, you're in luck
'Cause I will do whatever comes to mind
You'll go insane

Things I say don't usually come easily
There's one thing I need you now to know 'bout me

You know I'm under the influence
So don't trust every word I say, I say
When I'm under the influence
It's a blur, but I want my way, my way
You know I'm under the influence
So don't trust every word I say, I say
Sounds good without making sense
It's a blur, but I want my way, my way
When I'm under the influence

Take off, liquor; I feel the beat
Hold onto the floor but I keep spinnin' round and round
Swing me, baby, back on my feet
Hiding in the crowd; we're making love without a sound

Things I say don't usually come easily
There's one thing I need you now to know 'bout me

You know I'm under the influence
So don't trust every word I say, I say
When I'm under the influence
It's a blur, but I want my way, my way
You know I'm under the influence (oh, oh)
So don't trust every word I say, I say
Sounds good without making sense (sounds good without making sense)
It's a blur, but I want my way, my way
When I'm under the influence

Boy meets, boy meets
Girl meets girl
This is the best place in the world, ooh
Boy meets, boy meets
Girl meets girl
This is the best place in the world, ooh

[Wiz Khalifa:]
So, intoxicated and faded, I'm in the club, barely made it
I see the look on your face and it says that you want it later
But you ain't too into waitin', I fly you to different places
Took all your crew and amazing cause they ain't doing the same shit
Barely knew what your name is, don't care who you just came with
Make a move and get famous, get your mission completed
Use the other politic or entertainment
I just got a couple things I wanna know cause everything is moving slow
I usually wouldn't ask this though

[Tove Lo & Wiz Khalifa:]
You know I'm under the influence
So don't trust every word I say, I say (Wiz Khalifa man)
When I'm under the influence
It's a blur, but I want my way, my way
You know I'm under the influence (boy meets, boy meets, girl meets, girl)
So don't trust every word I say, I say
Sounds good without making sense (boy meets, boy meets, girl meets, girl)
It's a blur, but I want my way, my way
When I'm under the influence
