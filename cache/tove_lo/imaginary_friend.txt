People said you're not a superstar
Can't jump that far
You know better
Got my armor on with super glue
Come power through
Yeah, whatever

Crushing my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Feeling their doubt, shut them all out
Crushing my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Feeling their doubt, shut them all out
'Cause I need you

Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Keeping me dreaming
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)
Keeping me dreaming
(Don't you know I)
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)

Breaking bones to feel like I'm alive
How kids get high
Need to feel it
We want big things, but they make us small
No game at all
They don't feel it

Crushing my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Feeling their doubt, shut them all out
Crushing my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Feeling their doubt, shut them all out
'Cause I need you

Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Keeping me dreaming
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)
Keeping me dreaming
(Don't you know I)
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)

Crushing my heart, tear me apart
Hate on this world 'cause reality sucks
Crushing my heart, tear me apart
Feeling their doubt, shut them all out
Over, over again

(Don't you know I)
Keeping me dreaming
(Don't you know I)
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Keeping me dreaming
Imaginary friend, stay with me 'til the end now
Over, over again
(Don't you know I)

I don't know, I guess it's kinda like a voice in my heart
Reminding me that there's nothing to fear in the things I'm afraid of
