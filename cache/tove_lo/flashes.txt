Just because I'm present
Don't mean I forgot about you back home
You think I'm surrounded
But babe, I do most of this alone

People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
What about you?

When I fuck things up
When I fuck things up in front of camera flashes
What about you?
When all I built up
When all I built up with sweat, blood, tears just crashes
What about you?
What about you?

'Money is a problem'
You say in a way like I'm to blame
I don't really need them
All I want is for us to stay the same
What about you?

People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
What about you?

When I fuck things up
When I fuck things up in front of camera flashes
What about you?
When all I built up
When all I built up with sweat, blood, tears just crashes
What about you?
What about you?
What about you?
What about you?

Yeah, oh, what about you?
Oh, yeah, nah, when I fuck things up, yeah
Oh, yeah, fuck things up, what about you?
Oh, what about you (fuck things up)

(When I fuck things up)
Fuck things up
Coming over me
(All of these flashes)
What-a-bout-You?
(All of these flashes)
Comin' over me
When I fuck things up
In front of camera flashes
(All of these flashes)
What about you?
When all I built up, with sweat, blood, tears just crashes
What about you?
Fuck things up, yeah
