Fist fights, long nights
Come home late
Can't sleep, I keep
Me awake
Flip through
The lives on TV
I say, for now
I'm happy

Love it when I'm play pretending
When I can take bullets to the heart
Fucking up my happy ending
But I can take bullets to the heart

Breathe in balance and love
I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood
Yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone
Will they sing about me?
Dead and gone
Will they scream my name?
Scream my name?

Wake up, got up
And I'm bored
Night runs with guns
Too hardcore
Don't dare to care
'Bout someone
I'm dirt, I'm ice
Is that wrong?

Love it when I'm play pretending
When I can take bullets to the heart
Fucking up my happy ending
But I can take bullets to the heart

Breathe in balance and love
I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood
Yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone
Will they sing about me?
Dead and gone
Will they scream my name?

Breathe in balance and love
I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood
Yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone
Will they sing about me?
Dead and gone
Will they scream my name?
Scream my name?

Breathe in balance and love
I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood
Yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone
Will they sing about me?
Dead and gone
Will they scream my name?

Breathing violence and love
I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood
Yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone
Will they sing about me?
Dead and gone
Will they scream my name?
Scream my name?
