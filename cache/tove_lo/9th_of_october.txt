We never had coffee table books or dinner parties
We always had hazy nights and sex, clich√©'s in Paris
Don't disturb on the top floor
Getting high by the window
In bed with your eyes locked into mine
How perfect was it?

9th of October, I always remember
No bad things had happened then
Honestly, you never thought you'd fall for me
But somehow you got pulled in
Livin' so fast, makin' memories last
'Til our hearts couldn't hold no more
Hear you explodin' while I am implodin'
Now, how did we let this go?

We never had, ah
We never wanted, ah
We never had, ah
We never wanted
A normal kind of love

We never had time for useless fights
'Bout dirty laundry
We always had tender, long goodbyes
Packed bags in a hurry
Our last kiss at the bus stop
Had I known, would've jumped off
And now from the pieces of my heart, I'm so sorry

9th of October, I always remember
No bad things had happened then
Honestly, you never thought you'd fall for me
But somehow you got pulled in
Livin' so fast, makin' memories last
'Til our hearts couldn't hold no more
Hear you explodin' while I am implodin'
Now, how did we let this go?

We never had, ah
We never wanted, ah
We never had, ah
We never wanted
A normal kind of love

Waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
(We never wanted)
Waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
Still waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
We never wanted a normal kind of love

9th of October, I always remember
9th of October, I always remember
Those big words, I said them first
9th of October, I always remember
9th of October, can't think of it sober
'Cause all of it fuckin' hurts

Waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
(We never wanted)
Waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
Still waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
We never wanted a normal kind of love
Oh, waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
(We never wanted)
Waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
Still waitin' for my heart, waitin' for my heart
We never wanted a normal kind of love
