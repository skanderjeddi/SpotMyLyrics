I got fire eyes, glitter in my tear lines
And I'm coming down, ready for some new sounds
And I'm holding up all that I can think of
But, where are you?
Where are you?

Oh, lonely babe, stranded on the dance floor
Look for me, I know that I'm a handful
But you get me, know what you signed up for
Live up to the best and the worst of your dreams

All the cards with all the love cliches
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?
All the cards with all the love cliches
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?

I can feel the lights tingling from the sunrise
And I see the signs clinging to our last nights
Thinking you and I, we are all the same kind
So where are you
Where are you?

Oh, lonely babe, stranded on the dance floor
Look for me, I know that I'm a handful
But you get me, know what you signed up for
Live up to the best and the worst of your dreams

All the cards with all the love cliches
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?
All the cards with all the love cliches
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?

With a hand like this I'm folding
All you need, yeah, I'll be holding
(What the fuck do you think love is?)
With a hand like this I'm folding
All you need, yeah, I'll be holding
(What the fuck do you think love is?)

Where are you? 
Lonely babe
(Can't focus)
Look for me
(I lost you)
You get me
(What you wanted)
Live up to the best
Live up to the best and the worst of your dreams

All the cards with all the love cliches
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?
All the cards with all the love cliches
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?

Cling my hand like this and fold it
All you need, yeah, I'll be holding
(What the fuck do you think love is?)
Cling my hand like this and fold it
All you need, yeah, I'll be holding
(What the fuck do you think love is?)

Ah, fuck!
Ugh, I need another
