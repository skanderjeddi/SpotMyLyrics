So you're proud to be a good one
But the good ones always complain
About the stuff they never did

Don't make a thing about the bad kind
'Cause the bad kind don't even know
All the hearts they're messing with

You can point fingers, all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway
You can point fingers, all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway

Yeah, I've fallen in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am
Fallen in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
Yeah, I've fallen in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am
Fallen in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you understand?

I've been told I am the problem
And the problem's my honesty
When it's worse than how it seems
And I tell you all the wrong things
All the things you don't wanna hear
'Cause they change your perfect dream

You can point fingers, all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway
You can point fingers all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway

Yeah, I'm fallen in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am!
Fallen in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
Yeah, I'm fallen in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am!
Fallen in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
