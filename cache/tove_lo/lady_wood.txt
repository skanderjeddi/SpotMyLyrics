Nothing but a dirty mind
Player burning bridges where she goes
Looking like the freak card kind
But no one standin' around him wants him close

Ooh, wh-why
Ooh, wh-why
White noise in my head, ego
Ooh, wh-why
Ooh, wh-why
Judge a babe who dance alone

I know what people say about you
They say the same about me
I don't care if it's all true
I want you hanging with me
I want you, I want you hanging with me
I want you, I want you hanging with me

Rumors are their only friends
Spread that shit around's what turns them on
I can see all eyes expand
Oh, they can't believe I take you home

Ooh, wh-why
Ooh, wh-why
White noise in my head, ego
Ooh, wh-why
Ooh, wh-why
Judge a babe who dance alone

I know what people say about you
They say the same about me
And I don't care if it's all true
I want you hanging with me
I want you, I want you hanging with me
I want you, I want you hanging with me

Perfect imperfections with mistakes and a unlearned lessons
Yeah, you give me wood
Give me lady wood
Dirty on the inside, damaged goods with nothing but pride
Yeah, you give me wood
Give me lady wood

I know what people say about you
They say the same about me
I want you
I know what people say about you
They say the same-
I don't care if it's all true
I want you hanging with me
I want you, I want you hanging with me 
I want you, I want you hanging with me
I don't care if it's all true
I want you, I want you hanging with me
