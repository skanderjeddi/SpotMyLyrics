Two years of change
Now they say never change, never did
Keep loving me for a night
Think you're free? I don't quit
Come on my sweet escape for a while just to try it on
I'm dancin' away
While it's all fun and games 'til its not

We don't wanna go home
(Better dance for us)
You're fucked but, oh, you're so fun
(How you holding on?)
I don't know tomorrow
(If it comes or not)
But I promise for life you can brag 'bout tonight
You won't save the night for me
You won't save the night for me
You won't save the night for me
And I ain't never gonna go home

Ten years of highs just for fun
Not a height 'til I'm caught
Pain from the past like a small piece of glass in my heart
This should be the time of my life
You fucking made it your deal, your deal
And I keep dancin' away
'Cause it's all fun and games 'til its real

We don't wanna go home
(Better dance for us)
You're fucked but, oh, you're so fun
(How you holding on?)
I don't know tomorrow
(If it comes or not)
But I promise for life you can brag 'bout tonight
You won't save the night for me
You won't save the night for me
You won't save the night for me
And I ain't never gonna go home

Hey, you got drugs?
Just need a pick-me-up only for tonight
Don't tell anyone I was with ya
Yeah, it's good stuff, but I'm resistin' now
Take it if you want
Think I've fallen out of my feelings

We don't wanna go home
(Better dance for us)
You're fucked but, oh, you're so fun
(How you holding on?)
I don't know tomorrow
(If it comes or not)
But I promise for life you can brag 'bout tonight
You won't save the night for me
You won't save the night for me
You won't save the night for me
And I ain't never gonna go home
Go home

Hey, you got drugs?
Just need a pick-me-up only for tonight
Don't tell anyone I was with ya
Yeah it's good stuff but I'm resisting now
Take it if you want
Think I've fallen out of my feelings
