Trying to think of a way to get started
Stutter my flow
Train of thought just departed
Taste of mezcal on my breath
Let me get this off your chest
Open my mouth
All the gems falling out
Make you lose control

Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver, silver tongue
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver, got that silver tongue like, ah
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say?
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue

Clothes on the floor, but the bed's on the ceiling
Slurring my lines, but I'm nailing the meaning
I'll say what you want me to say
But talk only gets in the way
Rolling our eyes, no more words to describe how we lose control

Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver, silver tongue
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver, got that silver tongue like, ah
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say?
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue

I've got nothing on you
And all the things you do
Yeah, I've got nothing on you

Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver, silver tongue
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver, got that silver tongue like, ah
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say?
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue
