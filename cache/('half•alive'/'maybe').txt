(Maybe, maybe)
(Maybe, maybe)

Feel the weight, fill the space in the void of my own time
I'm surrounded in pain passed down through my bloodline
I have tried to escape from the maze but it's no use
These chains never break, never budge, never come loose

Story's over
Story's over

Standing still and it feels like I'm lost in a coal mine
Inside, realize I'm at war in my own mind
It's a place fear creates, I'll be here for a long time
And you don't know where I've been, you weren't there on the front lines

Story's over

Maybe it's not over
Changing is found in motion
Maybe there's balance when you're moving
Could stopping bring you closer
Maybe, tilts you over
Leaning into the same old story

Crossing over
(Maybe, ma, ma)
(Maybe, ma, ma)
Crossing over
(Maybe, ma, ma)
(Maybe)
Crossing over
(Maybe, ma, ma)
(Maybe, ma, ma)
Crossing over
(Maybe, ma, ma)
(Maybe, ma, ma)

Maybe fear can't define all the walls 'til you enter
And even blood couldn't bind who you are at the center
Could it be that you're more than the scars on the surface
As the heat is beneath all the ash of the embers

Crossing over
Crossing over

The way it's told, there's no more room to grow
The way it's told, there's no return home

Maybe it's not over
Changing is found in motion
Maybe there's balance when you're moving
Could stopping bring you closer
Maybe, tilts you over
Leaning into the same old story

Crossing over
(Maybe, ma, ma)
(Maybe, ma, ma)
Crossing over
(Maybe, ma, ma)
(Maybe)
Crossing over
(Maybe, ma, ma)
(Maybe, ma, ma)
Crossing over
