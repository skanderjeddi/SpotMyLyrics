I've been searching, nothing's working
I've been tripping, no one's perfect
Chasing vision, just the surface
Shirt's on backwards, not on purpose, yeah
I've been learning, something bigger
Expectations, feet were failing
I found blessings flowing from
The sight of heaven

Staring into my reflection, redirecting my perfection somewhere else
When there isn't any progress, lean on truth inside the promise, it is well

I hold my life out in front of me, dreams of who I want to be
I'm seeing every empty page
But I find that everything I am is everything I should be
I don't need to run away
I don't need to run away
Yeah I don't need to run away

Something's working, heart is turning
Vision's clear, and still I'm learning
That what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
Is something more than I can plan
Go, tell me now!
I don't need to run away

I've been standing on a stage with just a mirror, forced to face who I've become
Searching for a new escape, I scan the exits that embrace an easy out

I hold my life out in front of me, dreams of who I want to be
I'm seeing every empty page
I find that everything I am is everything I should be
I don't need to run away
I don't need to run away
(I don't need to run away)
I don't need to run away
I don't need to run away
I don't need to run away
No, I don't need to run away
