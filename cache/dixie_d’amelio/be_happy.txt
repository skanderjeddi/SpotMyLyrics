Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down just leave me there
Let me be sad

Sun's up, I already wanna lay down
Friends calling, are you really tryna go out? (No)
Don't wanna get dressed up to pretend (No)
I could lie and say I'm fine
Maybe you'll stop calling then

I've got chips on my shoulder
Only getting older
So I keep to myself
Ain't tryna complain
Just don't wanna explain it
But...

Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down just leave me there
Let me be sad
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low you don't need to care
Let me be sad

What's the matter with that? Oh oh oh
What's the matter with that? Oh oh oh
What's the matter with

Bad days, it's okay, let me feel it (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And some days you've got to break your heart to heal it (Heal it)
I know I'm gonna feel this way again
I can lie and say I'm fine
But that wouldn't change anything

I've got chips on my shoulder
Only getting older
So I keep to myself
Ain't tryna complain
Just don't wanna explain it
But...

Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down just leave me there
Let me be sad
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low you don't need to care
Let me be sad

What's the matter with that? Oh oh oh
What's the matter with that? Oh oh oh

What's the matter with sadness
Making me feel the way I feel right now
Goodness
Can't force it when you feel fucked up
It's the salt that's on my tongue
It's the salt that's on my tongue
But...

Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down just leave me there
Let me be sad
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low you don't need to care
Let me be sad

What's the matter with that? Oh oh oh
What's the matter with that? Oh oh oh
Just let me be sad
