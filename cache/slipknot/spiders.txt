Well you can go it alone
Or keep it in between
The pages of the books you burn
So no one gets to read
The fingers pull your stitches tight
But knowing someone's secret is not enough
Everyone's a little bit a lot of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

When now is not the time
Tomorrow disagrees
But your real world isn't ready to face
The face behind the real me
Time to think it over
I'm over trying to overthink, I've had enough, huh
Everybody's limited to what's on their mind

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Make yourself a martyr's pet
And watch them all escape (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
Make yourself at home instead (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
You'll lose your toxic waste (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Go it alone
Suffer for your feelings, I'm not enough (no, no, no)
But everyone's a little bitter all of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
