Yeah!

Past just saving, this is like escaping
Running wild in the middle of weeds
Eyes can't see me, careful with your breathing
Get away or they get to feed
Strength's not enough, be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer, you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better, begin it
Your energy won't keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

(Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures
Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures)

Vultures salivate poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation, cattle on displacement, you want
To reason but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all could fuck off and go back to hell where you belong!

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Plague! (Plague!) Don't panic (Plague!)
Don't believe the riddle that confuses you
Bitch! (Bitch!) So manic (So manic!)
I can see the light that exposes you
So dramatic, now it's all emphatic means
The bigger the mouth that I can eat you with
Force of habit, God you reek of your havoc
But consider the sources you've been tampering with!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing new!
New!
Oh!
Yeah!
