She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, 'Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?'
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, 'Be careful of what you do.
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts.'
And mother always told me, 'A-be careful of who you love,
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth.'

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice.)

She told, 'My baby, we'd danced 'til three.'
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine, oh, no
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby

A-people always told me, 'Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts.'
(Don't break no heart.)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

No, no, no

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, there's not me, baby.)
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
She says I am the one (No, babe.)
But the kid is not my son, no, no, no

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Don't call me Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
She stumbled onto the scene
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
