I am not chosen, or that unique
Honestly, you were and you chose me
Maybe I fucked up everything
Is this how it feels to be blue?
You said you'd love me, no matter what
You said you'd love me, is that what I loved?
All of these choices messed me up
And everyone's mean, except you

I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I think I probably loved the idea of you
And though I may be missing the feel of you
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I said it 'cause I no longer wanna hurt
I said it back to you 'cause you said it first
And though I may be wishing it wasn't true
I think I probably wasn't in love, I wasn't in love with you

I was too worried how we'd end up
I wasn't looking and you grew up
Now I'm here writing this dumb song
'Cause I can't even tell you the truth:

I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I think I probably loved the idea of you
And though I may be missing the feel of you
I think I probably wasn't in love with you
I said it 'cause I no longer wanna hurt
I said it back to you 'cause you said it first
And though I may be wishing it wasn't true
I think I probably wasn't in love, I wasn't in love with you

This is gonna break your heart
I'm so sorry, yeah I know
This is gonna break your heart
Is this all that life's about?
Trying to love how you turn out
I don't love it much at all
This is gonna break your heart
I'm so sorry, yeah I know
This is gonna break your heart
Is this all that life's about?
Trying to love how you turn out
I don't love it much at all
I don't love it much at all
