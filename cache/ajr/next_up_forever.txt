Your eyes are open
So never close them
You'll sail the ocean
Finding where you should be
And if you're broken
You'll make your own thing
You'll make it so big
For all the world to see
You'll make it so damn big
For all the world to see

I'm kinda scared to drop this album
Let's push it back another week
I wanna be next up forever
Find a way to never hit my peak
I kinda wish I was still a virgin
'Trying to finally see what sex is like!'
I wanna be next up forever
Forever I'll be second in line

Someday they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody help me (somebody help me)
Someday they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody help me (somebody help me)

This is my imagination
This is how it looks and sounds
But I gotta go so much bigger
So they can never shut me down
I'm kinda scared of graduation
'Cause who am I when this is done?
I wanna be next up forever
So the best is always yet to come

Someday they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody help me (somebody help me)
Someday they'll be talking about me
Right now, they're just walking around me
My God, are you growing without me?
Somebody help me

I gotta go so much bigger
So everybody's proud of me
Welcome to the Neotheater
Won't everybody take their seats
And I'll be next up forever

'Cause I don't know what's coming next
I know I gotta grow up some time
But I don't think I'm ready yet

I know I gotta grow up some time
But I'm not fucking ready yet

Your eyes are open
So never close them
You'll sail the ocean
Finding where you should be
And if you're broken
You'll make your own thing
You'll make it so big
For all the world to see
You'll make it so damn big
For all the world to see
