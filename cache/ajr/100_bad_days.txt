Remember when we all got drunk?
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my God I felt so dumb, lucky me
I wrote a song that no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my God I felt so alone, lucky me

When all is going wrong
And you're scared as hell
Watcha gonna do
Who you gonna tell

Maybe
A 100 bad days made
A 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me
Interesting at parties

A 100 bad days made
A 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me
Interesting at parties, yeah
No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you no more

(La, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da da
La, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da da)
No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you no more

Remember when she broke my heart?
Waitin' for the waiter to return my card
Right as I let down my guard, lucky me
We had to work a bit more hard
Only just to get a little bit less far
We could laugh about it all tomorrow
 Couldn't we?

When all is going wrong
And you're scared as hell
Watcha gonna do
Who you gonna tell

Maybe
A 100 bad days made
A 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me
Interesting at parties

A 100 bad days made
A 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me
Interesting at parties, yeah
No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you no more

(La, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da da
La, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da da)
No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you no more

(Screw your thing, it goes like this)

No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you

A 100 bad days made
A 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me
Interesting at parties, yeah
No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you
