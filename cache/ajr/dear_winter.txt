Dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope they don't make fun of you
When you grow up and go to school, okay?
'Cause Winter is a badass name
Dear Winter, I hope you talk to girls
Or boys or anyone you like
I just hope you don't stay in every night
'Cause I wish I was out tonight

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I'm hoping that someday, I can meet you on this Earth
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first

Dear Winter, I hope you like this song
And even when you're 13
And you scream at me for parenting you wrong
I hope it's still a badass song

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
You know I cannot wait to teach you how to curse
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first

Dear Winter, don't move too far away
And please don't say I'm hovering
When I text you to ask about your day
I wanna hear about your day

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Will we still hang out and talk when I'm no longer in charge?
Oh, dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope you let me take a shot with you on your 21st
But shit, you gotta ask your mom first

Dear Winter, I'm looking for your mom
I gotta find a girl that doesn't mind that I'm inside my head a lot
Winter, it won't be too long
First, I just gotta find your mom
