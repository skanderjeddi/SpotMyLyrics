Wasted, wasted love
You had so much to give
For giving me time
Darling, had enough
And now I understand
So put your hands in mine
Baby I will take you far away
Don't you know these are our golden days
Baby all the other boys they don't see what I see
Now won't you say you see it in me
Tamarinds and skinny jeans
Oh won't you be my summer love
Take you walking through the garden
And take my heart when summer comes

Take me to your special place
The one by the river in summer
I'll keep you safe
And don't be afraid of the love that you have
I won't let you down like the other boys did
I found you mmm
Darling I found you ohh
Baby I will take you far away
Don't you know these are our golden days
Baby all the other boys they don't see what I see
Now won't you say you see it in me
Tamarinds and skinny jeans
Oh won't you be my summer love
Take you walking through the garden
And take my heart when summer comes
