Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it's like, 'Wow!
I'm not crazy'

Don't kill me
'Cause I'm just the messenger
(Hm, hm-hm)
I already
Went and took my temperature
And I'm not sick
I took all my vitamins
(Hm, hm-hm)
Yeah, I'm not sick
I'm just kinda different

Oh different, so different
They tell us to be different
But no one told me I could go too far

Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it's like, 'Wow!
I'm not crazy'
(Ay)
Frankly, I feel insane (whoa-oh)
But you say you feel the same (whoa-oh)
And suddenly it's like, 'Hey,
I'm not crazy'
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-a)
'Cause when you talk it's like, 'Wow,
I'm not crazy'

Don't kill me
'Cause I'm just the messenger (Hm, hm-m-m)
I've never seen
Someone quite this strange before
You're just like me
You took all your vitamins (Hm, hm-m-m)
You're just like me
And you take delight in it

Oh different, so different
They tell us to be different
But no one told me I could go too far

Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk, it's like, 'Wow!
I'm not crazy'
(Ay)
Frankly, I feel insane (Whoa-oh)
But you say you feel the same (Whoa-oh)
And suddenly it's like, 'Hey,
I'm not crazy' (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-a)
'Cause when you talk it's like, 'Wow,
I'm not crazy'

(When you talk it's like, 'Wow'
When you talk it's like, 'Wow'
When you talk it's like, 'Wow')

When you talk it's like, 'Wow'
When you talk it's like, 'Wow'
When you talk it's like, 'Wow'

Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
(Ay-ay-ay)
And get-togethers get me down
(Ay-ay-ay)
But when you talk, it's like, 'Wow!
(Ay-ay-ay)
I'm not crazy'
