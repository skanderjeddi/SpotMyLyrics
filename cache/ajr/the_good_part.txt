Have I done my best here, or
Will I be here next year, or
Are these my best years yet?

Was looking forward to
Being important, but
I'm not important, yet

If you put this scene
On a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the world gets me
Where I'm s'posed to be
Will I know I've made it, then?
It's so hard
Can we skip to the good part?

If there's a good part, then
I hope it's not far, 'cause
I thought it'd be today

I napped on campus, and
I smoked at dances, but
It didn't feel so great

If you put this scene

Where I'm s'posed to be
Will I know I've made it, then?
It's so hard
So can we skip to the good part?

These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But what am I gonna do with mine?
These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But, what the hell am I gonna do with mine?
