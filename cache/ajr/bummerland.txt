Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here

This month I got seven haircuts
And now my hair is all gone
It's sad but I've been alone for too long
So I keep getting haircuts

It's my all time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say

Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, sorry dear
But you're only going up from here

My friends always pay for my drinks
I can't afford no nice things
But I hope my bank account gets so low
Even zero
So next year
When I buy that first beer
I'll be a goddamn hero

It's my all time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say

Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, sorry dear
But you're only going up from here

Daa da-da da
Daa da-da da
Daa da-da da ('Cause you're only going up from here)
Daa da-da da...

It's my all time low
And I just can't wait
'Cause the quicker I'm there
Is the quicker I'll say

Bummerland, here I am
Better nix my summer plans
Bummerland, give a cheer
'Cause you're only going up from here
Bummerland, here I am
And there ain't no funner land
Bummerland, it's kinda weird
But you're only going up from here
