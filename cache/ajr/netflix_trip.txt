I had my first crush in season two
She'd pass me notes and fill our hands with glue
And in my corduroys we'd walk to school
I sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do
She moved away, I was on season three
It hit my heart so hard I'd hardly speak
But I could find some peace and privacy
A paper company to sit with me

Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?

I turned down Jameson when I was twelve
I spent that Friday night with Steve Carell
The one where Dwight became the head of sales
My eighth grade graduation wished me well
I lost my grandpa during season six
I watched my mom, she cried and held her kids
My mind was broken up, I couldn't think
So I just hugged her the way Michael did

Now, who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?

Wonder where we're going
Tell me who I am
Take in every moment
Hold it close again

Now the finale's done and I'm alone
I'm on a Netflix trip here on my phone
But who I am is in these episodes
So don't you tell me that it's just a show.

Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?

Oh, Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?

Who am I to tell me who I am?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
