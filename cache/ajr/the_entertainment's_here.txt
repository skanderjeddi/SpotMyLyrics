Oh my, oh my God, the entertainment's here
Everything is suddenly amazing here
Sit back man, relax man
Sit back man

I used to be distracted by my favorite song
I loved it very much, I made the song my alarm
And now I kinda hate hearing it every morn
Don't wake up anymore, I don't wanna be bored
I used to be distracted rolling round in the dirt
But recently I'm thinking 'bout my purpose on earth
But I don't wanna think about my purpose no more
'Cause it may come up short, man I hate being bored

I've been thinking
That too much thinking
Can start me sinking down
But...

Oh my, oh my God, the entertainment's here
Everything is suddenly amazing here
Sit back man, relax man
Sit back man, don't make plans
Oh my, oh my God, the entertainment's here
You don't even gotta use your brain from here
Just, sit back man, relax man
Sit back man, come on then

(The entertainment's here!
The entertainment's here!)

I used to be distracted by my burgers and shakes
I'm running out of things that I can do with my day
'Cause I can only eat so many times in a day
Till I'm bored again, and I'm stuck in my brain
You wonder what they did before inventing the phone
Yeah, how could anybody face the quiet alone
I'd rather be in Vegas than my very own home
Yeah, my cash'll be gone, but my mind'll be blown

I've been thinking
That too much thinking
Can start me sinking down
But...

Oh my, oh my God, the entertainment's here
Everything is suddenly amazing here
Sit back man, relax man
Sit back man, don't make plans
Oh my, oh my God, the entertainment's here
You don't even gotta use your brain from here
Just, sit back man, relax man
Sit back man, come on then

(The entertainment's here!
The entertainment's here!
The entertainment's here!
The entertainment's here!)
