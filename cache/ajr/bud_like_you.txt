Way up, way up, way up to the sky!
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high.
Way up, way up, way up to the moon!
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you!

Enough. Enough. There's no celebrities here
So why's the bouncer taking everything so seriously?
It's you, and I
It's cool you feel the same
Like why's the DJ here if he's just pressing play?

Kickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement
Hatin' all the same things too
If I need a pick-me-up, would you come and pick me up?
I could really use a bud like you
To pick me

Way up, way up, way up to the sky!
When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high.
Way up, way up, way up to the moon!
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you!

Way up, way up, way up to the sky!

Way up, way up, way up to the moon!
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you!
Boy it's good to know I got a bud like you!

Enough. Enough. There's no one here that we know
I think I knew a girl who knew the host but she's headin' home
We're standing, laughing, at the disco ball
Like who'd invest in that, when no one's lookin' at it?

Kickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement
Hatin' all the same things too
If I need a pick-me-up, would you come and pick me up?
I could really use a bud like you
To pick me
