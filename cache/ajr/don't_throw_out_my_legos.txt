My new address is hard to remember
So I wrote it on the back of my hand
'Cause I leave the nest, this coming December
To make it as a grown man
I'm about to lose my only defenders
I'm packing up whatever I can
Been waiting for today but
All I can think to say is

Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home

Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out, I don't wanna move on

People want shirts, with the band name on it
And suddenly we ain't so bad
Saved up enough to rent an apartment
Far away from mom and dad
My Christmas card looks like a mugshot
'Cause suddenly I'm getting sad
Been waiting for today but
All I can think to say is

Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home

Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out, I don't wanna move on
Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out, I don't wanna move on

It's cold out there, you're standing there
You're trying to face your greatest fear
You're shivering, you're trembling
It's warm in here so come back in

Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh, no, I'll come by when I'm grown
It won't be the same, though
I can't even go home, go home

Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out, I don't wanna move on
