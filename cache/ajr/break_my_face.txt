(Okay!)

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

You run your mouth
Your tongue fell out
It's right there on the ground
But now
You'll never drown
You can't, you got no mouth
So it ain't all bad now

What doesn't kill you
Makes you ugly
Life gives you lemons
At least it gave you something

Okay!
So if I break my face
And I don't look so great
My face is just my face
Okay!
So if I break my face
It ain't my darkest day
My face is just my face
I'm okay

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

You roll your eyes
A hundred times
At every phony line
Are your eyes okay?
They rolled away
Right down the interstate
But at least you can't cry today

Okay!
So if I break my face
And I don't look so great
My face is just my face
Okay!
So if I break my face
It ain't my darkest day
My face is just my face
I'm okay

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

What doesn't kill you
Makes you ugly
Life gives you lemons
At least it gave you something
What doesn't kill you (doesn't kill you)
Makes you ugly (makes you ugly)
Life gives you lemons
At least it gave you something

Okay!
So if I break my face (I break my face)
And I don't look so great
My face is just my face
'Cause everything is going great
So if I break my face
It ain't my darkest day
My face is just my face
I'm okay

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I'm ok
At least it gave you something (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
At least it gave you something (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
