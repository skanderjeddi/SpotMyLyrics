This hospital's got lots of crying kids
A minute ago, I did not exist
It's nice to finally meet my relatives
I bet it's always gonna stay this fun
I bet it's easy staying away from drugs
I bet our parents always stay in love
Always stay in love

Oh, what a life
So me and all my people
Gon' be stepping in time (wow)
Me, my
Oh, what a life
So me and all my people

I'm one minute old today
And everything is going great
Thank you
For coming to my birthday party
I'm one minute old today
And my minute's been going great
And I hope it stays that way

I bet this Instagram's a load of fun
It's best to show the best of everyone
I bet it never bites us in the bum
I bet my ignorance is always bliss
Except ignoring pigment in our skin
I bet my country's nice to immigrants
And that's just how it is

Me, my
Oh, what a life
So me and all my people
Gon' be stepping in time (wow)

It's nice to finally meet my relatives
I bet I'll never outgrow all my friends
I bet I'll see our female president

And that's just how it is
