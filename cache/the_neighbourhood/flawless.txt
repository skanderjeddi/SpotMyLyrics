She planned ahead for a year,
He said, 'Let's play it by ear.'
She didn't want him to run,
He didn't want her to fear

Nobody said it'd be easy,
They knew it was rough but tough luck

I fell in love today,
There aren't any words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's enough for me,
She's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw – you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

So, she put his heart in a bag,
He wouldn't ask for it back
He didn't want her to cry,
She didn't want to be sad

She said, 'You better not leave me.'
This shit'll be fucked for days and weeks and months, but...

I fell in love today,
There aren't any words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's enough for me, she's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw – you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

And I add it all up, I can find it
The problem with love is I'm blinded by
It rattles my lungs, but my mind is
Tangled between your little flaws
Your flaws, your flaws, your flaws

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw – you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

Wait for love, I won't wait for love
Wait for love, I won't wait for love
Wait for love
