No matter where you go, you'll never have control
No one makes it out alive, no one makes it out alive
In paradise

Picture you in summertime
Drinkin' white wine, an empty girl
Told me that you'll see me
And I see ya and I really wanna believe ya, I do
Singin' blues, no shoes on
Strummin' in the sun and you've got your feet up
I remember when you used to tell me that you'd find your freedom
It was hard to believe ya

'Cause you never feel enough, it never fills you up
And if lyin' on an island is the closest that you'll come
Then run, go ahead, have fun, run

No matter where you go (doesn't matter where you go)
You'll never have control (no, no, no, no)
Woke up feeling paralysed (yeah)
No one makes it out alive (yeah)
In paradise (yeah)

Picture me in the major leagues
Livin' in a dream that I created, mhm
I wrote my own books so I never had to read your pages
I've got no patience for that anyway
Sensations don't mean anything
If I can just have everything
Some days I think I'll run away
What would I even do if I made it?
I just keep on fading 'cause

I never feel enough, it never fills me up
I'm climbin' up a giant rock, I'll never reach the top
But I can't stop, I can't stop, so

No matter where I go (doesn't matter where I go, no, no)
I'll never have control (never ever have it under)
Woke up feeling paralysed (yeah)
No one makes it out alive (yeah)
In paradise (yeah)
Paralysed (yeah)
No one makes it out alive (yeah)
In paradise (yeah)

Band—band of brothers

With your band of brothers
