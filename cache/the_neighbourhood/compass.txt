If I don't have you with me, I'm alone
You know I never know which way to go
I think I need you with me for all-time
When I need new direction for my mind
You listen to my lectures on the phone
You help me find the treasure in the hole
You'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool
I know that you're not something to lose, now

I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you
(Could you tell me where to go?)

You're always there to help me when I'm down
I'm lucky you've been keeping me around
You're the star I look for every night
When it's dark, you'll stick right by my side

I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you

Like a magnet
Hard to imagine anything changing
Anything changing my way
Baby, like a magnet
Can't help that I'm attracted to you, I am
Could you keep on guiding me?
(Please)

I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you
(I might get lost without you)
I've got something to confess
I might get lost without you
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you
