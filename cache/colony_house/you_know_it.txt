Take that picture from that frame
I put it in my pocket so that every day you're with me
I keep you close to my heart
Give me one more kiss before the boys arrive
Nashville to San Francisco is a hell of a drive
But don't worry, the Lord is good when the road is wrong

And we'll be back before you know, you know it
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I said you know, you know it
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Woo

All the pretty people and the places I've seen
Make up for every dollar cause I'm living the dream
I ain't worried, I'll be fine
Because the tank ain't empty but it's feeling low
I'm sorry San Francisco but I just got to go home
To my baby, because she's holding it down

But we'll be back before you know, you know it
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I said you know, you know it
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

But when the days grow long she's alright, hey
Every night I know that she's still mine
But don't you break my heart
You're the only guarantee I've got
Hold on a little longer I'll be back right to you
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it...

But we'll be back before you know, you know it
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I said you know, you know it
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Hey
