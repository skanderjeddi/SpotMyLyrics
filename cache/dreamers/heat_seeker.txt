Johnny brought a rocket to a knife fight
He got sick of people thinking he's a good guy
Had a Big Mac head for a small fry
Balenciaga shades so they never see him cry

I've been searching all night
Light the fuse and let me take flight
I'm a

Heat seeker, I just wanna find the truth
Heat seeker and I'm shooting at the moon
Heat seeker, yeah, I'm looking for the way
I'd rather be lost than to stay the same
Heat seeker, I just wanna find the truth
Heat seeker and I'm shooting at the moon
Heat seeker, yeah, I'm looking for the way
I'd rather be lost than to stay the same

Internet killed the video star
Taking selfies while she crashed in her new car
Polyamorous dreams of a teen heart
But she'll never find love in a graveyard

I've been searching all night
All alone in my lonely mind
I'm a

Heat seeker, I just wanna find the truth
Heat seeker and I'm shooting at the moon
Heat seeker, yeah, I'm looking for the way
I'd rather be lost than to stay the same
Heat seeker, I just wanna find the truth
Heat seeker and I'm shooting at the moon
Heat seeker, yeah, I'm looking for the way
I'd rather be lost than to stay the same

Here we go, here we go
Can't stop the wind when it wants to blow
Can't stop the rain, better learn to float
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Can't stop the wind when it wants to blow
Can't stop the rain, better learn to float

Heat seeker, I just wanna find the truth
Heat seeker and I'm shooting at the moon
Heat seeker, yeah, I'm looking for the way
I'd rather be lost than to stay the same
Heat seeker, I just wanna find the truth
Heat seeker and I'm shooting at the moon
Heat seeker, yeah, I'm looking for the way
I'd rather be lost than to stay the same
