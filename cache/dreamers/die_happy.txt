Yeah I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time

I met a girl, she had expensive perfume
Was a waste of money, didn't smell so lovely like you
And now you're on my steps up late night
Chainsmoking Pall Malls while I philosophize

Glass sky, killin' time
You leaned up on my shoulder
And my thoughts dried
Didn't mind
So alive I felt like I could die

So alive
I felt like I could die
Happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole
My spare time
Yeah I could die
Now that I've been floating
High up on the smoke in
Your eyes

And I've been burned yeah
And I've burned myself
Saw no point in falling
Just to burn somebody else
But now your dreams are catching my eye
Maybe we could stay up and pretend for a while

Glass sky, killin' time
You leaned up on my shoulder
And my thoughts dried
Didn't mind

So alive
I felt like I could die
Happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole
My spare time
Yeah I could die
Now that I've been falling
High up on the smoke in
Your eyes

And in the darkness we leave our bodies
Leave our bodies, so alive

So alive
I felt like I could die
Happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole
My spare time
Yeah I could die
Now that I've been falling
High up on the smoke in
Your eyes
