[Tove Lo:]
Ask me for my cigarette
Just so he can taste my lips and start to work me
Calculate his every step
Feel his hands around my hips, here comes the head tip
Kiss him in the French way (ooh-la-la-la)
Professionally passionate, head to a private place
So I can reciprocate (ooh-la-la-la)
Let me be an astronaut, locked in your airspace

[Jax Jones & Tove Lo:]
Je m'appelle Jacques, and I love you a lot
I'm with you tonight, but tomorrow I'm not
Je m'appelle Tove, get the show on the road
I'm down for one night, let's go

[Tove Lo:]
(Ooh-la-la-la) No talking now, pull on my waist
(Ooh-la-la-la) 'Cause I want you doing bad things to me, to me
(Ooh-la-la-la) Always on top, I need a change
(Ooh-la-la-la) I'm over it, I just want your weight on me, on me
(Ooh-la-la-la)
(Ja-Ja-Ja-Jacques) I just want you on me
(Ja-Ja-Ja-Jacques) I just want you on me

Yeah, I kinda like the view
On a mission to position myself right underneath you
Boy, that was good for me (ooh-la-la-la)
Don't really do this, but hey, you wanna go again?

[Jax Jones & Tove Lo:]
Je m'appelle Jacques, and I love you a lot

(Ooh-la-la-la)
(Ja-Ja-Ja-Jacques) I just want you on me
(Ja-Ja-Ja-Jacques) I just want you on me

Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little touch me
(Ja-Ja-Ja-Jacques)
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little touch me

No talking now, pull on my waist
'Cause I want you doing bad things to me, to me
Always on top, I need a change
Come over it, I just want your weight on me, on me

On me
I just want you on me (On me)
Oh yeah, want your loving on, on me
I just want you on me (On me)
Oh yeah, on me
