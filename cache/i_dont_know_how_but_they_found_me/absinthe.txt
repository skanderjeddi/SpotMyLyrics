Bring to me
Your sons and daughters
'Cause Absinthe makes the heart
Grow fonder

I don't care what momma says
You'll wind me up
Or you'll wind up dead

I don't care what momma says

I don't believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I won't believe whatever this is
Whatever they give you
Stop drinking it down

If I were you
Then I'd stop talking
Cause soon you'll be a dead man walking

I don't care what momma says
You'll wind me up
Or you'll wind up dead

I don't care what momma says

I don't believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I won't believe whatever this is
Whatever they give you
Stop drinking it down

I hear voices
I see visions
These spirits
Are your prison
I hear voices
I see visions
These spirits
Are your prison

I don't believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I won't believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I don't believe whatever this is
