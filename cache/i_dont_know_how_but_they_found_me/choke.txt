Stop, drop and drag me into place
Lock the fire escapes
I'll break your pretty face
Yeah, yeah

Oh, you clever little things
The sycophantic teens
What a precious basket case
Yeah, yeah

Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine
What a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue and choke yourself to sleep

Yeah, yeah

You get everything you want
The money always talks
To the idiot savants
Yeah, yeah

Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine
What a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue and choke yourself to sleep

Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine, oh
What a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue and choke yourself

Yeah, yeah
