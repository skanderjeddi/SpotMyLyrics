Come break some hearts now, tear them out
We're filing for amusements with the crowd
Oh, but we advise participation, it's required
Doing things not typically allowed

Feels like we're having a good time
It's true, a wonderfully good time

When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you

Different defections, cut the lines
Leagues of social climbers all about
Oh, but we advise no restitution
Comes tonight, â€˜less we lay unconscious in the ground

Feels like we're having a good time
It's true, a wonderfully good time

When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you

But if the lights don't stop me
No one's got control of what I do
'Cause it's a good time

When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
