Big shot, so what, do you wanna pretend?
You took the money but the money couldn't buy a friend

Now I want you to leave me alone
They say the devil that you know is better than the devil that you don't
Oh, you're a big shot here but nobody else knows
Now I want you to leave me alone

Blind spot, take your best shot, lucky me
Go fly a kite until you're tangled in the hanging tree

Now I want you to leave me alone
They say the devil that you know is better than the devil that you don't
Oh, you're a big shot here but nobody else knows
Now I want you to leave me alone

Four in the morning but we're having such a lovely time
Mad as a Hatter with a dagger and a dollar sign
Aristocrat, tip your hats and break your mother's heart
And when the sun comes up, you'll find a brand new god

Now I want you to leave me alone
They say the devil that you know is better than the devil that you don't
Oh, you're a big shot here but nobody else knows
Now I want you to leave me alone
