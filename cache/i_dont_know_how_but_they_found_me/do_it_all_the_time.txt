Ha!

We're taking over the world
One kiss at a time
And then I'm taking your girl
And I'm making her mine

No reason why
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time

We're taking over the world
A little victim-less crime
And when I'm taking your innocence
I'll be corrupting your mind

No need to cry
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
(Do it all the time)

Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
It's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
Get your money from a trust fund
Do it all the time

Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
And it's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
I don't wanna do it, but I do it
'Cause I do it all the time

Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
It's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
Get your money from a trust fund
Do it all the time
