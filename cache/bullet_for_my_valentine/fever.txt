It's hot as hell in here
Everybody wants to lose control
The music's turned up loud, the lights
We'll turn them low

Wound up like a hurricane
And my head's about to explode
Can't wait to self-destruct
Can't wait to let it go

(Whoa-oh) She hits the stage
(Whoa-oh) She makes me crave
So come and get my money (whoa-oh-oh-oh)

I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me?
I can feel your fever, taking over
Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy

Whoa come on!

So I'm looking for a spark
I've got a body to re-ignite
Don't worry you won't get burned
So don't, don't put up a fight

Push hard to breaking point
And I'm ready to overload
No limits and no regrets
It's time to sell my soul

(Whoa-oh) You're all I want
(Whoa-oh) You're all I need
So come and take my money (whoa-oh-oh-oh)

I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me?
I can feel your fever, taking over
Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy
That you're the remedy!

Come here you naughty girl you're such a tease
You look so beautiful down on your knees
Keep on those high heel shoes rip off all your clothes
You smell so fucking good it makes me lose control!

Losing control! (you're all I want)
Selling my soul! (you're all I need)
Losing control! (you're all I want)
I can't let you go!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me?
I can feel your fever, taking over
Got a dirty feeling that you're the remedy
That you're the remedy
You are the remedy!
