Breath, should I take a deep?
Faith, should I take the leap?
Taste, what a bittersweet
All my, all my life

Let me face, let me face, let me face my fears
Oh, let me face, let me face, let me face my fears
Won't be long, won't be long, I'm almost here
Watch me cry all my tears

Lose, soon have nothing to
Space, this is what I choose
A mile, could you walk in my shoes?
All your, all your life

Let me face, let me face, let me face my fears
Oh, let me face, let me face, let me face my fears
Won't be long, won't be long, I'm almost here
Watch me cry all my tears

Watch me cry all my tears

Let me face, let me face, let me face my fears
Oh, let me face, let me face, let me face my fears
Won't be long, won't be long, I'm almost here
Watch me cry all my tears
