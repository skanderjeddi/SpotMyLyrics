Sparkling angel
I believed
You were my saviour
In my time of need

Blinded by faith
I couldn't hear
All the whispers
The warnings so clear

I see the angels
I'll lead them to your door
There's no escape now
No mercy no more

No remorse 'cause I still remember
The smile when you tore me apart

[Chorus:]
You took my heart
Deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams
I wished they would turn into real
You broke the promise
And made me realise
It was all just a lie

Sparkling angel
I couldn't see
Your dark intentions
Your feelings for me

Fallen angel
Tell me 'why?'
What is the reason?
The thorn in your eye

I see the angels
I'll lead them to your door
There's no escape now
No mercy no more

No remorse 'cause I still remember
The smile when you tore me apart

[Chorus]

Could have been forever
Now we have reached the end

This world may have failed you
It doesn't give you reason why
You could have chosen
A different path of life

The smile when you tore me apart

[Chorus:]
You took my heart
Deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams
I wished they would turn into real
You broke the promise
And made me realise
It was all just a lie

Could have been forever
Now we have reached the end
