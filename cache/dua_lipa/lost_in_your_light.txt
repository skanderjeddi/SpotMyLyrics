[Dua Lipa:]
Over and over
Waves of running feelings
Floating weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking
Honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

[Miguel:]
Oh
Now everything's vivid, vivid
Touch attempted with pleasure
Reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted
Woman

[Both:]
Hold me, trust me
[Miguel:]
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
[Both:]
Hold me, trust me
[Miguel:]
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

[Both (Miguel):]
Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, alright)

Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

[Dua Lipa (Miguel) {Both}:]
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, darling)
{Let's get lost in the light, baby} (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, all night)
{Let's get lost in the light, baby}
