You, you turned gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

So watch it blow
When I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake
It'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
