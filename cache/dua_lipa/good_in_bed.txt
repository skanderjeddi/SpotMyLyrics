(Hey)
Yeah, let's get to the point yeah
You love to disappoint me, don't cha?
You tell me what I want
But ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could
Probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my waist

I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my
Head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other
Mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
Ple-e-e-e-ease
Come take it out on
Me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
And the long nights where we did everything
But talk it through, that's what we do yeah
You always let me down boy
But when you going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone
Who do me like you do

I been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my waist

I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my
Head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other
Mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
Ple-e-e-e-ease
Come take it out on
Me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

We don't know how to talk
But damn we know how to fuck

I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my
Head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other
Mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
Ple-e-e-e-ease
Come take it out on
Me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
