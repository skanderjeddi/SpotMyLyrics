I wanna know
Do you even feel it, do you even feel it now?
And you're not alone
So don't be hesitatin' for my lovin'

(Ah) Oh, I'm down on my knees
Mercy, whoa, whoa, whoa, baby

Preach
Mm, teach me, baby
Teach us, a-preach it, baby
Preach
Soul lovin', do the soul lovin'
(Preach it, baby)

You gotta say
Nothing too specific, you know I'll get it anyway
A hip's gotta sway
So shake it like your mama, and seven day prayer

(Ah) Oh, I'm down on my knees
Mercy, whoa, whoa, whoa, baby

Preach
Mm, teach me, baby
Teach us, a-preach it, baby
Preach
Soul lovin', do the soul lovin'

Preach it, baby, preach
Preach it, baby, preach
Preach it, baby, preach
Preach it, baby, preach

Shout it from the rooftops, scream it from the pulpit
Yell it till I hear you sell it like you fought and
Shout it from the rooftops, scream it from the pulpit
Yell it till I hear you, ain't no doubt about it, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby
Preach
Mm, teach me, baby
Teach us, a-preach it, baby
Preach
Soul lovin', do the soul lovin'
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby
Preach

Preach it, baby, preach
Preach it, baby, preach
Preach it, baby, preach
