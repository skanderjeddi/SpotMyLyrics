When it's tough
When you get stuck
You're at the wall
Of the writer's block
You need a spark
A light in the dark
To get you out of your head
And into your heart

Taking a walk on the wild side
Something in the way she moves
Candle in the wind
And it's blowing everywhere we go
All these girls got something going on
Met in the club her name was Lola
Champagne tasting Coca-Cola
In the hands of my loving
My love does her good
All us boys need something, that they got

This one's for Elise
Norma Jean, Pattie Boyd and Carole King, Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman, Candy Darling got it started with a song

This one's for Elise

The muses of the Greeks and Romans
Steal the immortal beloved of Beethoven
They all lit a spark and you know that they got it going
Shout out to the girl, over there, in my chair:

Whoa Elise, Norma Jean, Pattie Boyd and Carole King, Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman, Candy Darling got it started with a song

This one's for Elise

This one's for Elise, Norma Jean, Pattie Boyd and Carole King, Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman, Candy Darling got it started

For Elise, Norma Jean, Pattie Boyd and Carole King, Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman, Candy Darling got it started with a song

This one's for Elise...
