I see you when you're down and depressed, just a mess
I see you when you cry, when you're shy, when you wanna die
I see you when you smile, it takes a while, least you're here
I see you, yes, I see you

I'm alone with you, you're alone with me

I see you when you hide, and when you lie it's no surprise
I see you when you run from the lie within your eyes
I see you when you think that I don't notice all those scars
I see you, yes, I see you

I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
What a mess you made of everything
I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself

Like I see you
Yes, I see you
I see you
Yes, I see you
(I'm alone with you, you're alone with me)

I see you when you chase all the dreams inside your head
I see you when you laugh and when you love to the bitter end
(I see you) In the dark, at the dawn of something new
I see you, yes, I see you

I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself

Like I see you
Yes, I see you
I see you
Yes, I see you

Even when you cry and even when you're shy
You mean everything to me
Even when you lie and even when you hide
You mean everything to me
I see you
(I see you, I see you, I see you)
Yes, I see you
(I see you, I see you, I see you)
I see you
Even when you cry and even when you shine
Yes, I see you
(I see you, I see you, I see you)

I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself
