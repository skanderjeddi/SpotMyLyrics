Woke up in the morning feeling cynical, typical
Tryin' wipe the sleep out my bloodshot eyes, did I just die?
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah

I've been feeling self-destructive
But I love it
I can't help myself
Your taste is so seductive, I'm feeling

Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
In my mind, can't rewind
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
All the time, that's my life
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
In my mind, can't rewind
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
All the time, that's my life

Frontin' 'bout my day and feeling criminal, habitual
I try to hide my pain behind a broken smile
So outta style
La, di-da, di-da

I've been feeling self-destructive
But I love it
I can't help myself
Your taste is so seductive, I'm feeling

Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
In my mind, can't rewind
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
All the time, that's my life
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
In my mind, can't rewind
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
All the time, that's my life
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

I've been feeling self-destructive
But I love it
I can't help myself
Your taste is so seductive, I'm feeling

Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
In my mind, can't rewind
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
All the time, that's my life
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
In my mind, can't rewind
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
All the time, that's my life

Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
In my mind
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
All the time
