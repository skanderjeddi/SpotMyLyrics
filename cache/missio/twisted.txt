My mother, she told me
'Don't get in trouble'
My father, he told me
He knew I would
My brothers, they told me
'Don't give a damn'
My sister, she told me
To do something good

I'm uncontrollable, emotional, chaotically proportional
I'm visceral, reloadable
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted

My mother, she told me
'Don't be a quitter'
My father, he told me
He knew I was
My brothers, they told me
'Do what you do'
My sister, she told me
To do something good

I'm uncontrollable, emotional
Chaotically proportional
I'm visceral, reloadable
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted

My mother, she told me
My father, he told me
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
