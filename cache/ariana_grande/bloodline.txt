You're the one that I'm thinkin'
Got me feeling so incredible
Would you mind maybe linking?

Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
Put it down, then it's time to go
Get it like you love me
But you don't, boy, it's just for show
Take it or leave it, you gotta take it or leave it like uh-uh

Don't want you in my bloodline (yuh)
Just wanna have a good time (yuh)
Ain't no need to apologise, no

I ain't looking for my one true love
Yeah, that ship sailed away

Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
