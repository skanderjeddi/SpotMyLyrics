Take-take it all away
Save my heart for another day
I'm up late on the telephone
And I'm all alone
With the dial tone

Wait-wait 'til the sun is up
Drown my dreams in a coffee cup
Palms out wanna beg for luck
But I'm way too proud
Never giving up

Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give and something's got to break
I know, someday it's gonna happen
Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now

Give-give everything I've got
Out of reach but I'll take a shot
Kick rocks in the parking lot
Feel like giving up
But I'll never stop

Run-run, running like a fool
Never win if you never lose
Find hope and a little truth
Wanna learn new tricks
Gotta jump through hoops

Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give and something's got to break
I know, someday it's gonna happen
Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now

Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever, not forever
Won't stay down

Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever, not forever
Won't stay down

And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now

And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me
I'll go down
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
