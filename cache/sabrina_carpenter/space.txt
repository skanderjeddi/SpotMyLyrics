Under pressure
Questions all around, but there's no answers
Try to keep my pace, they want it faster
Records all around they give me shelter, shelter

No need to hurry, no need to rush
I tell them my story, it's never enough
It's never enough

I'm hiding from my shadows, running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching, you're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom, I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching, you're right there watching me

So give me a little, give me a little, a little more space
Just give me a little, give me a little

Satisfaction
All we ever want, but I can't have it
Scribbles on the page, they call it magic
Makes me wanna be what you imagine, imagine

No need to hurry, no need to rush
I tell them my story, it's never enough
It's never enough

I'm hiding from my shadows, running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching, you're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom, I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching, you're right there watching me

When their eyes are all around
Give me, give me, give me space
Keep it low, don't make a sound
Give me, give me, give me space
When their eyes are all around
Give me, give me, give me space
Keep it low, don't make a sound
Give me, give me, give me space (space)

I'm hiding from my shadows, running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching, you're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom, I need some room to breathe
(Give me some room to breathe)
But I know that you are watching, you're right there watching me

When their eyes are all around
(I'm hiding from my shadows)
Give me, give me, give me space
Keep it low, don't make a sound
(I know that you are watching)
Give me, give me, give me space
(I need a taste of freedom)
When their eyes are all around
(Give me some room to breathe)
Give me, give me, give me space
Keep it low, don't make a sound
(I know that you are watching, watching me)
Give me, give me, give me space

Just give me a little, give me a little, a little more space
(Just give me some space)
Just give me a little, give me a little, a little more space
(Just give me some space)
Just give me a little, give me a little, a little more space
(A little more)
Just give me a little, give me a little
Just give me some space baby
