Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Sometimes life gets bitter
I get strung out, caught in the middle
And I can't breathe
I just need a little taste of paradise
I know a place I can escape to
Where I go, troubles never break through
The grass is greener, my head is clearer
I got peace of mind when I fall into your eyes

Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite songs spinnin' in my head
Keep it play playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love
That's what your love's like

Stop signs, I keep on runnin' into
Red lights make me wanna scream like
Why can't it just be only you and me all the time
In a world no one can find

Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite songs spinnin' in my head
Keep it play playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love
That's what your love's like

When life has left me numb
And I need a pick me up
There's no better rush than your love
Your love, your love

Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite songs spinnin' in my head
Keep it play playin' on repeat
It's like walking on the ceiling
Can't compare the feeling
Better than I could ever describe
It's like soaking in the sunrise
Not a worry on my mind
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love
That's what your love's like
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Woh-Oh-Oh-Oh
That's what your love's like
