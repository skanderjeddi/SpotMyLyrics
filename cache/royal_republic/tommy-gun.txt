I guilty stand before you
I know I misbehaved
I never meant to hurt you

I humbly beg forgiveness
Hope that my soul be saved
And if I had a final wish pretty miss I would only ask this:

I want you to do me with a tommy-gun baby
With a tommy-gun baby do me
GUN-TOMMY
If you have to kill me use a tommy-gun baby
Use a tommy-gun baby do me
GUN-TOMMY

There ain't no use appealing
Your justice will prevail
This time I must be punished

No lawyer no attourney
No chance of breaking bail
So won't you grant this final wish pretty miss?
Won't you save a last kiss?

I want you to do me with a tommy-gun baby
With a tommy-gun baby do me
GUN-TOMMY
If you have to kill me use a tommy-gun baby
Use a tommy-gun baby do me
GUN-TOMMY

I want you to do me with a tommy-gun baby
If you have to kill me use a tommy-gun baby

GUN-TOMMY
GUN-TOMMY
GUN-TOMMY
Aaaah shoot me...
Whooh!

I guilty stand before you
I know I misbehaved
I never meant to hurt you

I humbly beg forgiveness
Hope that my soul be saved
But if I had a final wish...
I would only ask this...

I want you to do me with a tommy-gun baby
With a tommy-gun baby do me
GUN-TOMMY
If you have to kill me use a tommy-gun baby
Use a tommy-gun baby do me
GUN-TOMMY

I want you to do me with a tommy-gun baby
If you have to kill me use a tommy-gun baby
GUN-TOMMY!
