You're a roundhouse kick to my heart

You always get centerfolds
Even though you start getting old
People say that I'm wasting my time
Cause you ain't no good to me

Well I guess we had the good ol' time
Somebody's gotta draw the line
Sentimentallyletting you go
Cause you ain't no good to me

(Stuck in the middle)
Starting to understand
(Little by little)
This is getting out of hand
(Kung fu lovin')
It's gonna tear us apart
You're a roundhouse kick to my heart
To my heart

You always played center staged
And you leave me in a fit of rage
Now I know that I gotta get gone
Cause you ain't no good to me

Everybody likes a little pain
But baby this is going down the drain
Sentimentally letting you go
'Cause you ain't no good to me

(Stuck in the middle)
Starting to understand
(Little by little)
This is getting out of hand
(Kung fu lovin')
It's gonna tear us apart
You're a roundhouse kick to my heart
To my heart

Kung fu lovin'
It's gonna tear us apart
You're a roundhouse kick to my heart (6x)
Kung fu lovin'
You're a roundhouse kick to my heart (5x)
