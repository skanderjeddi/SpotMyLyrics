People say that I'm over the top

Ugh!

You can't shut me down!
I got another one coming up
I got one more thing to touch
I wanna get inside!
Oh Bam! I love how we collide!
All our differences aside
I take it in my stride

A lot of heartaches, riches and tores
The more you suffer, the more you rejoice
What do you do when it gets to rough?
What do you do when too much is not enough!?

I don't wanna come on down!
No, I never wanna come on down!
I start and I never stop!
People say that I'm over the top!
Just like I'm killing time
Just like us just killing crime
While I wait for the bomb to drop!
People say that I'm over the top!
(This is all real)
Oh, we were revoked just to go to waste
Written just to be erased
One down two to go
All the time with a one-man show
(Hot damn!)
Hot damn!
(Water in the city!)
To me people want no pity
Smile we're running the gun
Aren't we having fun?

A lot of heartaches, riches and tores
The more you suffer, the more you rejoice
Maybe tomorrow's a good day to die?
Maybe today is a good day to be alive!?

I don't wanna come on down!
No, I never wanna come on down!
I start and I never stop!
People say that I'm over the top!
Just like I'm killing time
Just like us just killing crime
While I wait for the bomb to drop!
People say that I'm over the top!

Whoaw hey!

I don't know where I'm going
If you don't know where to go
You don't want my affection
'Cause my love is just for show
Don't need another reason
Don't need another side
Just take me up on life support
And I'll fine

I don't wanna come on down!
No, I never wanna come on down!
I start and I never stop!
People say that I'm over the top!
Just like I'm killing time
Just like us just killing crime
While I wait for the bomb to drop!
People say that I'm over the top!

People say that I'm over the top!

People say that I'm over the top!

People say that I'm over the top!

People say that I'm over the top!
