Got out of bed this morning
I didn't sleep at all
Today, I'm making history
I'm picking up my call
I'm going into space, man
Don't know when I'm coming down
But I'll send you all a message
When I'm passing my old town

So tell me why is it
We're never happy?

Everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars
Everybody wants to show a brother what they've got
Everybody wants to be an astronaut

I can feel my body shiver
The lights are everywhere
They marvel at my heartbeats
Inside the atmosphere
And I'm looking at the world
In a way you never could
I knew I'd be a travelin' man
But I misunderstood

So tell me why is it
We're never happy?

Cause everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars
Everybody wants to show a brother what they've got
Everybody wants to be an astronaut

Don't you tell me that I'll never
I will show you what I'm made of
Ready for the E.V.A
Come on, let's get outside and play
What you say?

Everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars
Everybody wants to show a brother what they've got
Everybody wants to be...

La la la la la la la la...

Everybody wants to be a superstar
Rock the world and make the cover of the Time
Cause everybody's happy when they're playing the guitar
Everybody wants to be
Everybody wants to be
Everybody wants to be an astronaut
