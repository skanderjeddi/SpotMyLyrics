I take a walk on the shelf that I made for myself
I'm gonna walk it 'til the day I die
I write the song in my head they're gonna play when I'm dead
And I know it's gonna get you high

Cause I'm a man
I don't expect you to understand
Cause I'm a man
And I do what I do because I can

Cause I keep getting all the things that I want
That I want, that I want, that I say that I want
It's all good cause I get what I want
But you don't understand
I'm a twenty-first-century-getleman

My little baby singing devils all over the place
Because I threw my drink all over her seat
I got the song in my head, and I play it instead
I turn it up because I like the beat

Cause I keep getting all the things that I want
That I want, that I want, that I say that I want
It's all good cause I get what I want
But you don't understand
I'm a twenty-first-century-getleman

Baby
B-b-baby
B-b-baby
Uh!

We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!

We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
We're all twenty-first-century-gentlemen!
