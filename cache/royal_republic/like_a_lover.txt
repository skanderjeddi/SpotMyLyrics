Feelin' shitty in the city
So I took her away
For a quiet little holiday
She's admitting as we're sitting
By the dock of the bay
That she's almost over me

Feelin' shitty in the city
So I took her away
For a quiet little holiday

Now where do we go?

'Cause you look like a lover, you feel like a lover
'Cause you look like a lover, you feel like a lover
Ain't no body like your body
Nothing gets me through
Like a lover like you

She was dying for something
To get her off of the ground
She didn't even make a sound
I could see it in her eyes
How she longed to be free
But then she got on top of me

Feelin' shitty in the city
Shit in the city

Now where do we go?

'Cause you look like a lover, you feel like a lover
'Cause you look like a lover, you feel like a lover
Tell me now baby, what do you want?
Ain't no body like your body
Nothing gets me through
Like a lover like you
Ain't no money, like your money
Nothing fits my shoe
Like a lover like you
Ain't no honey, like your honey
Nothing makes me 'oh!'
Like a lover like you

Ain't no body like your body
Nothing gets me through
Like a lover like you
Ain't no money, like your money
Nothing fits my shoe
Like a lover like you
Ain't no body, like your body
And I've never had a lover
Like a lover like you
Nothing leaves me blue
Like a lover like you
