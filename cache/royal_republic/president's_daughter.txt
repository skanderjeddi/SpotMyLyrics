I'm just a poor boy
And my day is on repeat
I live amongst the common
I know the smell of concrete
You are the president's daughter
But you are blue, baby blue
I've got a getaway-plan
And that is what we're gonna do!

She's got it all
I want her
In love with the president's daughter
It can't be right
It's not fair
I'm in love with the president's daughter

So, I'm standing there
Waiting at the gate...
A shadow of a man in front of me
I thought I heard him say:
'Hey, you wanna get with the president's daughter?
You ain't get it tonight!
And I said:
'Forgive highness if I seem out of line
There is only one thing on my mind'

She's got it all
I want her
In love with the president's daughter
It can't be right
It's not fair
I'm in love with the president's daughter

She's so sad
She's all alone
200 bodyguards outside her door
She's got style
She's got class
She's got a smile
She's got cash...

The president's daughter
The president's daughter
Oh yeah, oh yeah, come on

Oh yeah

She's got it all
I want her
In love with the president's daughter
It can't be right
It's not fair
I'm in love with the president's daughter
