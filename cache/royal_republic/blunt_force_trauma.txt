Blunt force trauma

I'm pickin' it up
You bring it on down
I gotta get out tonight 'cause I'm sick of stickin' around
You say it ain't cool
I say it's all fine
You better go suck it up 'cause I've had enough of your whine

What can I say?
You can't fight love, but we try anyway
Don't you know we're the king and queen of drama
You call it love I call it blunt force trauma

I make up my mind
You make it undone
I'll make it back up again 'cause I'm all done havin' no fun
You say you don't mind
I say you don't care
I gotta get out tonight 'cause this love ain't goin' nowhere

All the boundaries go like a domino
I can't shake you off of my case
Like a shooting star, you take it to far
And you need to get out of my space

What can I say?
You can't fight love, but we try anyway
Don't you know we're the king and queen of drama
You call it love I call it blunt force trauma

Our kind of love is a violent case
Our kind of love has a bitter sweet taste
Our kind of love is a kick in the face

So I'm picking it up
You bring it on down
I gotta get out tonight 'cause I'm sick of stickin' around
You say you don't mind
I say it's all fine
You better go suck it up 'cause I've had enough
And I've had enough and I've had enough
And you had enough of my time

What can I say?
You can't fight love, but we try anyway
You and I are the king and queen of drama
You call it love I call it blunt force trauma
