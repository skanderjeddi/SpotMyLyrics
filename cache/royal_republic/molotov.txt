Get out of my way because I can't see straight
There will be no negotiation when I'm in this state
Yeah, I know I got a problem but I'll do it anyway
Just another shot of fire and I know I'll be OK
If you wanna talk about it, come again another day

So can I get another shot of...
I need another shot of...
I want another shot of...
Molotov

Let's set this place on fire cause I don't wanna dance
Well, nobody ever gets it, nobody understands
So don't you give me all the bullshit, I'm filling up the glass
I don't need an intervention because I'm heading for a crash
Your mouth is writing checks that your face is gonna cash

So can I get another shot of...
I need another shot of...
I want another shot of...
Molotov

So can I get another shot of...
I need another shot of...
I want another shot of...
Well can I get another shot of...
I want another shot of...
I need another shot of...
So can I get another shot of...
Molotov
