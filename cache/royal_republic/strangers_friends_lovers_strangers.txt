I know it's over and so do you
We were together but now we're through
And I wanna ask you something and I hope that it's alright
Even though it's over can I still spend the night?

Why did we become strangers, friends and lovers
How did we become such a tragedy
Why did we become strangers, friends and lovers and strangers again

I remember when you knew better than I knew myself
Now it's like you don't know me at all
I might be some crazy midnight stalker
Yeah, I might be Johnny-God-Damn-Walker

Why did we become strangers, friends and lovers
How did we become such a tragedy
Why did we become strangers, friends and lovers and strangers again

I know it's over and so you do
We were together, but now we're trough
And I wanna ask you something and I hope that it's alright
Even though it's over can I still spend the night?

Why did we become strangers, friends and lovers
How did we become such a tragedy
Why did we become strangers, friends and lovers
How did we become such a tragedy
Why did we become strangers, friends and lovers and strangers again
And again, and again, and again
