Come on

When I see you dance with another
When I see you dance with another
I can't bring myself not to bother
When I see you dance with another

(Come on!)

When I see you talk to another
When I see you talk to another
I got no choice but to go undercover
When I see you dance with another, come on!

Ho! Ha! Ho!

I can't get you off of my mind
I can't get you off of my mind
Gotta know your love is unkind
I can't get you off of my, my, my mind

Yeah!
Come on!

When I see you dance with another
When you put your hands on another
I can't bring myself not to bother
When I see you dance with another, come on!

When I see you walk with another
When I see you talk to another
I got no choice but to go undercover
When I see you dance with another
Ho! Ha! Yeah

Wow!

I can't get you off of my mind
I can't get you off of my mind
Gotta know your love is unkind
I can't get you off of my, my, my mind

With every second, my heart gets colder
With every minute, you're getting bolder
If you wanna do it, do it to my face
If you wanna do it, do it to my face (oh come on)
If you wanna do it, do it to my face
If you wanna do it, do it to my face (oh come on)

I can't get you off of my mind
I can't get you off of my mind
Gotta know your love is unkind
I can't get you off of my (MY) mind
I can't get you (I can't get you)
I can't get you
Say it: 'I can't get you'
I can't get you
And if I can't get ya, no one can
I can't get you (off of my mind)
I can't get you (off of my mind)
I can't get you (off of my mind)
I can't get you (yeah, yeah)
I can't get you off of my mind
I can't get you off of my mind
I can't get you off of my mind
I can't get you off of my, my, my mind
