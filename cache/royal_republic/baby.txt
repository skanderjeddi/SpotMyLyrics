She left you standing in the hall
She said 'Don't take it personal'
Come on, b-b-b-baby, carry on
It's time to sing a different song

She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your baby! Rawr!

You're tired of walking on your own
And that empty house just ain't a home (ba-b-b-b-b-babe, whoo!)
Come on, b-b-b-baby, carry on
It's time to sing a different song
(Different song, different song, different song)

She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your baby! Rawr!

Whaow!
One is one and two is three
It's time to live in ecstacy (ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby)
Come on, b-b-b-baby, load your gun
From here on out it's hit and run

She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your baby! Rawr!
