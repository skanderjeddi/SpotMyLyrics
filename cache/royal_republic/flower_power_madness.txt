Diamonds are forever
And gold never gets old
Take me now or never
'Cause I'm out of my control
Girl you give me fever
Send shivers down my spine
Call me a believer
And put love back on the line

It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
You're givin' me flower power madness
It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
You're givin' me flower power madness

Take me to your Venus
Fly me to the Moon
Don't let the sun between us
Or we'll burn away to soon
It hurts in my emotions
You better kiss me quick
Somebody call a doctor
This beat is fuckin' sick

It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
You're givin' me flower power madness
It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
You give me that flower power madness
I know not every hippy gets high, it's a lie lie lie
It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
Would you give me that flower power madness
It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
Give me some of that flower power madness

Your love is like a fire
It burns within my soul
So spread it like you mean it
Make half a man a whole
I might be going down
But man it feels like winning
So take me to your church
And I'll make your choir sing it

It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
You're givin' me power... Power Ranger!
It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
You give me that power
It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
You give me that power sugar magic
It feels like I'm gonna lose my mind
Would you give me that power, pizza, mmm!

So give me that slice of pie
Come on give me that slice of pie
Come on give me that slice of pie
Give me that flower power
Give me that slice of pie
Come on give me that slice of pie
Come on give me that slice of pie
Give me that flower power madness
Give me that slice of pie
Give me that slice of pie
Won't you let me take a shower
In the power of your flower
Give me that slice of pie
Give me that slice of pie
It's not power ranger, ain't a stranger, through your danger
