I got to get this of my chest
Don't wanna be like all the rest
Is it true what they say - what they do? I'm gonna put it to the test
You know they love it when you break
And they will live for your mistakes
They make the rules for the wise and the fools, but you're nothing but a fake

You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you

I got to get this of my chest
Don't wanna be like all the rest
Is it true what they say - what they do? I'm gonna put it to the test
You've got to get this in your head
It doesn't matter what they say, what you said
'Cause you know they like you better, when you're dead

You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you
Yeah!

You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody
You ain't nobody 'til somebody hates you
