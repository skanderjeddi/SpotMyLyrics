Look out, they're closing in on you now
Wake up, or you'll wake up six feet down
Nobody's got your back in this town
Knock em in the teeth now
Out here there's no negotiation
No room to start a conversation
Before you get a taste it's taken
Never let your guard down

Get back, put your hands up
Kinda messed up, but it's tough luck
And I'm sorry, but I don't feel bad for you
Cause I know if, you could switch this
You'd be dishin' out the same shit, sayin' sorry, but I don't feel bad

Now I know
There's no one I can trust
I used to think there was
Tell me that I'm cutthroat (hey)
I think you got your eyes closed
Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here (hey)
The killer in the mirror

Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror

Where did, all of the good people go?
They hide, behind the bars on windows
In hopes, they can forget we're close
Tryna get some of what they've got
Cause I, used to believe in justice
A place, where there was better judgment
But now, I'm feeling so disgusted
By the have its and the have nots

Get back, put your hands up
Kinda messed up, but it's tough luck
And I'm sorry, but I don't feel bad for you
Cause I know if, you could switch this
You'd be dishin' out the same shit, sayin' sorry, but I don't feel bad

Now I know
There's no one I can trust
I used to think there was
Tell me that I'm cutthroat (hey)
I think you got your eyes closed
Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here (hey)
The killer in the mirror

Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror

Knock em in the teeth now
Never let ya guard down
Get some of what they've got
Have its and the have nots
Knock em in the teeth now
Never let ya guard down
When they step in your house
Knock, knock, knock em all the fuck out!

Now I know
There's no one I can trust
I used to think there was
Tell me that I'm cutthroat (hey)
I think you got your eyes closed
Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here (hey)
The killer in the mirror

Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror
(Killer in the mirror yeah)
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror
(Killer oh yeah)

Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here (hey)
The killer in the mirror

Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror
