Climb until you're getting high
Be a part of the scene like you're living your dream
Walk the room like you're on fire
Like your chasing the truth, gripping tight to your youth
(Holiest thing I know) (Holiest thing I know)
Gripping tight, gripping tight to your you-ou-ou-ou-outh
(Holiest thing I know) (Holiest thing I know)
Like you're cha-, like you're chasing the tru-u-u-u-uth

But 
You're 
The 
Holiest thing I know
Yes, 
You're 
The 
Holiest thing, holiest thing I know

[Tei Shi:] Look at the mess you've made
[Glass Animals:] Babe, I'm not what you think
Come on, listen to me
[Tei Shi:] Now all I do is feel afraid
[Glass Animals:] Can't you see that I'm here
Can't you see I've been played
(Holy) (Holiest thing I know)
Then I'm dest-, then I'm destined to fla-a-a-a-ame

But
You're
The
Holiest thing I know
Yes, 
You're 
The
Holiest thing, holiest thing I know

(Holiest)
(Holiest)
(Hol-holiest)
(Holiest thing I know)
(Holiest)
(Holiest)
(Hol-holiest)
(Holiest thing I know)
(Holy)
(Holiest)
(Hol-holiest)
(Holiest thing...)

Glum 'til you're getting high
Be a part of the scene like you're living your dream
Walk the room like you're on fire
Like you're chasing the truth, gripping tight to your youth

But 
You're 
The 
Holiest thing I know
Yeah,
You're 
The 
Holiest, holiest thing I know
