What'll it be now mister mole 
Whisper sloth in curls of smoke 
Take a back seat 
Or play pharaoh 
Dance with me 
And shake your bones

Slow down
It's a science 
He's been waiting 
To bring you down 

Snake eyed 
With a sly smile 
He can hold you 
And shake you child 

Leopards laze each 
On plush pillows 
Slender capes
Of red and chrome 

Paperback dreams 
In their deep doze 
Twitch their toes to 
Black mambo

Slow down
It's a science 
He's been waiting 
To bring you down 

Snake eyed 
With a sly smile 
He can hold you 
And shake you child 

Wanna play cheat
Now says the sloth
A domino
Flush to his nose 

Tickle that cheek 
And take your throne 
Pump your veins 
With gushing gold

Slow down
It's a science 
He's been waiting 
To bring you down

Snake eyed 
With a sly smile 
He can hold you 
And shake you child 

We can hold you 
We can hold you 
We can hold you 
We can hold you
