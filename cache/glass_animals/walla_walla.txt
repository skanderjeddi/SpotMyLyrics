Hi my little naked man
I saw you there looking sad
Face so lost, petrified
Timid twitch in your wide eyes

My oh my such strange supplies
Many spoons all in a pile
Did you bend ‘em with your mind?
Precious precious right right right

[Chorus:]
Honey honey, don’t you cry
It’s a ruse
All these creatures are a lie
Funny bunny, it’s alright
I clap my hands
And they’re gone into the night

Wiggle toes on wicker braids
Hanging with their nails so frayed
Mini fruits all bone dry
And a cape, black tie-dyed

I bet I can make you smile
In the pools of moonlight
Watch this little trick of mine
Say with me this tiny rhyme

[Chorus]

Take my hand
