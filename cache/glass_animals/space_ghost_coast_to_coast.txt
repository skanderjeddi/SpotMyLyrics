Said to you, 'Why did you do it?'
Touch the glass, I'll feel you through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot

You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

Gotta be all that coco, eyy?
Playin' too much of that GTA
Playin' too much of that Dr. Dre
Doom, Quake, where'd you get the gun from, eh?

Really think that metal gonna make you safe?
Playin' peek-a-boo with the devil these days
Black cap back with a trench coat, eyy
Living in the valley cuttin' porno tapes

You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

Were you bored of gender norms?
Of bein' alone, no mama home
A bad divorce, or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own

Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro?
You wore her old bath robe
Too small to see the road

We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokemon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and real monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom

You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook, names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frames
Super villain with a manifesto, dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you, man

Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007 Nintendo games
Burnin' Hot Pockets in the microwave

You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
