Drip drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk
Is incredible
So, so, so unusual
You taste like surfing videos

I'm gonna read your mind
(Big dicks and big ol' titties on the sly)
Say I got Aries eyes
(Fuck no, I'ma a bonafide Aquemini)

Oooh, who you hiding?
White Russians and dirty diamonds
You fake your shyness
I just wish that I could see through you

Cheap booze
Pepsi blue
You got bottles in from two thousand and two
Hot glue
Vape juice
Hit undo, how the hell are you so cool?

Drip drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk
Is incredible
So, so, so unusual
You taste like surfing videos

It's chemical warfare
Red lips and television eyewear
Raspberry soda hair
In the pool in a blow-up gummy bear

Fake youth
Scooby Doo
Push pops on the corner of the roof
Fruit Loops
Super food
Chat shit but where's the real you?

Never seen The Price Is Right
I'm a liar, I've been on that shit since '99
You make me like a clown
Clap clap, you're a clever, clever cookie now

Waterfalls coming out your mouth
What the hell are we doing now?
Waterfalls tearing you apart
What the hell are we doing now?
