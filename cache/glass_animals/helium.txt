You gonna call it or am I?

One more time
This puppy love is out of line

One more slide
And then we're back to real life

Oooh and I'm falling now but it's so wrong
You talk like a man and taste like the sun

Oooh and you lift your eyes up from the dust
I knew just then I knew it was done

I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know a part of you's at home with him
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know a part of you's not part of this

Soft blue skies
Helium balloons float up away

Broad daylight
But we're sunflowers in the rain

My momma said they used to be white pyramids
They float above the sand they're slowly sinking in
Are our foundations destined to keep crumbling
Just 'cause we started this with zero innocence?
I just can't build on something that begins like this
It's a blood diamond, flawless but for that one thing
