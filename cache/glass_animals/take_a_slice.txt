[Dialogue:]
It smells good up here
Yeah, the candle yo, it's a sausage, sausage candle
Most people don't do it the way I do it very personal
So, like, even the money
Twenties, twenties, Twenties
Y'know like whatever, I just like sausage

I don't ever wanna pick a slice
One is pretty but the other lies
Chewing on a fat smoke
No filter but you're puffing
Suckin' on a slim vogue
Dark Fingernail polish

I'm the treasure baby I'm the prize
Cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie
Shitty old pistola
Shot a bullet thru my wallet
Gonna go to Pensacola
Gonna fuck my way through college

You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cos you live in my day dreams
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cos you live in my day dreams

Sitting pretty in the prime of life
I'm so tasty and the price is right
Stewing in the black dope
I'm filthy and I love it
Studebaker all gold
Got a shotgun in my pocket

You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cos you live in my day dreams
