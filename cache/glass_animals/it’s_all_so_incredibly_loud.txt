Oooo...

I break you
I cup your face
Awaken
Two eyes
Blue lakes
Open sesame

Super silence in the quiet
Eye inside the storm
Water from your broken iris
Fall toward the floor
Everything, waiting, shaking as it drops
I tried for you and I, for too hard, for too long
Gave it all and everything for more time, but I lost

Oooo, we're breaking down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

Oooo...

Oooo, I'm breaking down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

Two hearts folding
Pulling everything

Oooo, I'm breaking down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud

Oooo, I'm breaking down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
It's all so incredibly loud
It's all so incredibly loud
