Baby, don't go
I'll stop breathing coke
No more bloody nose
No more John Does

Steam rolled hair
Look into the glare and pop it brother
Slick like 007 man
You fly like Kim Jong rockets [x4]

Burn through my love
Just like your drugs
I've had quite enough
Or lack thereof

Steam rolled hair
Look into the glare and pop it brother
Slick like 007 man
You fly like Kim Jong rockets [x2]

Steam rolled hair
Look into the glare and pop it brother
Slick like 007 man
You fly like Kim Jong rockets...
