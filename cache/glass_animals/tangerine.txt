As cold as an old ice cream sandwich
As focused as Mr. Miyagi
You poke at your phone postin' aerial photos
Of you with your smoothie
I can't keep on makin' you happy
'Cause you got issues with your daddy
I miss ramen noodles and laughing at you
And your gran in home movies

But I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?

I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

You let the Devil in
And all you talk is money, money
Money, money, money
It's so funny how it changes how you feel
How you see, how you need, how you sleep
All your freedom, caffeine
How you're lookin' at me
But I love it when the light sits on you just right
Tiny tangerine speckles painted in your eyes

Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

Oh, my God
Drop the beat

You've been dreamlessly sleepin' for years
Super clear since the late 1990s
You only look at me properly now
When you're drunk, watchin' movies
Where are you? What happened?
I want what we had, where you gone? Where you hidin'
It's 2:23, you got Friends on repeat
On repeat, on repeat, on repeat
On repeat, on re-

I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?

I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine

I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, Tangerine
Do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, Tangerine
