[Denzel Curry:]
Huh, huh, huh

[Dave Bayley:]
Two things 'bout the geez, you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-
Drug lust and two packets in your pocket
Clear score, dust hits your nose like a rocket

Doo doo doo, doo, doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo, doo doo doo doo doo

Scoot-scoot, boy, race up to the super-club
Let rip, like you drank all of the tequila
Get loose, streetfighter, tear it up
Fresh footwear drippin' out of you onto the rug

[Dave Bayley & (Denzel Curry):]
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Wavey Davey's on fire
You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh)
Wavey Davey's on fire
Oh, you still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh)

[Denzel Curry:]
Huh, huh
Huh, huh
Huh, huh

Ayy, what is everybody talkin' 'bout?
When they wanna live fast, but I'd rather walk it out
Niggas wanna talk about a G, but I spend a G on the twelve teeth in my mouth (Huh, huh, huh)
Diamonds aquatic, it feel like trout on my wrist (Wrist)
Or a spout on my wrist, put a spider up in it (In it)
Everything gotta be eighty and you keep the twenty percentage
You know that I get it, I'm on and I'm in it
If you try to take it, the clip get extended
I'm back on my bullshit, like Jordan, no Pippen
If this is my life then I'm Tokyo drifting (Uh)

[Dave Bayley & (Denzel Curry):]
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor (Yeah, oh)
Ain't nothin' better
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Wavey Davey's on fire (Yuh, yuh, yuh, okay)
You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh, huh)
Wavey Davey's on fire (Yuh, yuh, yuh, okay)
You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh, huh)

Hm, huh, huh
Wavey Davey's on fire
You still got it, you still got it al-
You still got it, you still got it al-
You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah
