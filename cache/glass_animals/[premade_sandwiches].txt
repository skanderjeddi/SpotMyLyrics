People standing in line to look at pre made sandwiches
People standing in line to get high to 'bad bitches'
People standing in line to smoke weed that's green tea
People standing in line for two rails of oxiclean
People standing in line to nuke themselves with ketamine

It's artisan raw and gluten free
Probiotic superfood antioxidant low msg
Non GMO locally sourced quinoa and chia seeds
Jojoba and baobab dog treats
Hand made with wild goji berries
Agave, acai and activated whey protein

People standing in line to buy whatever the McFuck they might
Want to shove down their foodpipes tonight

New watch in black gold
New shirt that looks old
Big dick and no soul
New pants with four holes
Old phones in one drawer
Five dry pens something from a kinder egg
And everything you didn't know you were looking for

People complaining cos' their mum whines
People complaining about losing their minds
People complaining about standing in line
People standing in line and they don't even know why
