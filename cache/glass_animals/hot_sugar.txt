Long black tulips
Born in your blue tints
Lemongrass eyelids
Smoke in your slick lips

Chocolate chapstick
Backbeat strat flips
Swimming pool spaceships
Light through the wave tips

Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too

So cool but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar

I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like

Bath time cool whip
Watermelon juice kiss
Esprit gold rims
Skin so sun-licked

Santal freshness
Hologram glasses
Put it on plastic
You never been desperate

Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too

So cool but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar

I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you

Just wanna be like you
Just wanna be like you
Just wanna be like you

So cool but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar

I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you

So cool
So cool
So cool
