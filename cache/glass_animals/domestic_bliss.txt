I see the bruise, I see the truth
I see what he's been doin' to you
Blood on the shoes, what's his excuse?
He say he doin' some new kung fu
You always use his bullshit excuse
But I see what he's been doin' to you

Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why'd you go back for that kiss?
Maybe it tastes like him when you got tears in your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why don't we pack and leave this?
Why do you smile when he cries?
Why do you cry when he wins?

Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin'
Please, on my, on my knees
Go to Hawaii
Fight for me
Said we can leave, I'm beggin'
Please, on my, on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii

He got balloons
New flowers too
Last one's dyin' in your bedroom
He's squeezin' you
Blame, blaming you
Mama just usin' her red perfume

Domestic bliss
I know how bad you wanted it

Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why'd you go back for that kiss?
Maybe it tastes like him when you got tears in your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit?
Why don't we pack and leave this?
Why do you smile when he cries?
Why do you cry when he wins?

Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin'
Please, on my, on my knees
Go to Hawaii
Fight for me
Said we can leave, I'm beggin'
Please, on my, on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii

My God, I'll be right in
A trickle of lightning
I knew before I heard
I felt in my skin
My God, I'll be right in
A trickle of lightning
I knew before I heard
I felt in my skin

Fight for me
We can leave, I'm beggin'
Please, on my, on my knees
Go to Hawaii
Fight for me
Said we can leave, I'm beggin'
Please, on my, on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii
