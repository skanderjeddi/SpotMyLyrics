Break the fuckin' mirror 'cause I hate the image
Every single tear I cry is wasted liquid
I fucked too many girls to count, I ain't commited
I guess bein' an asshole was a bad decision

Thanks haters I love
You, no one above
You, I lost a thousand friends to threads, like where's the undo?
Tweetin' like I ain't affected by the hate directed every second, maybe I should take the weapon blow

Where are you going?
My serotonin
I'm feelin' alone and the world is so cold
It's hard to focus
Without oxytocin
Love is an ocean I can't control

Break up with my girl because she doesn't trust me
I don't fuckin' blame her 'cause I trust in nothin'
Mama held a bottle, daddy doesn't hug me
All I ever wanted was someone to love me

Thanks doctor I need
Thoughts give me a free dose
I took a thousand happy pills but I'm still emo
Actin' like I ain't affected by the hate directed every second
Maybe I should fuckin' end it now

Where are you going
My serotonin
I'm feelin' alone and the world is so cold
It's hard to focus
Without oxytocin
Love is an ocean I can't control

Chemicals, chemicals in my brain
Where'd you go, where'd you go anyways?
Left a hole where the bad wants to stay
Everything, everything goes away
Chemicals, chemicals in my brain
Where'd you go, where'd you go anyways?
Left a hole where the bad wants to stay
Everything, everything goes away
