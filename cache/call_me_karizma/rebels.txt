Raise some hell before we ghost
Break the rules, a broken nose
You know us, we're soldiers
Rips and holes in baggy clothes
Drippy heart from head to toes
We won't budge, for no one
Rebels

Walkin'
Don't know where we goin' but we mobbin', yeah
You lookin' for the juice well we got it, yeah
Get out our way or join in the riot
Hear the sirens?
(Quiet, shh)

Everything is burning and I love it
Sit and watch the world until it's nothin'
Scared of goin' out into the public, yeah
We the kings now
Take it if you can't afford to cop it
Talk about a baller on a budget
Gloomy till they put me in a coffin, yeah
Let us sing now

Raise some hell before we ghost
Break the rules, a broken nose
You know us, we're soldiers
Rips and holes in baggy clothes
Drippy heart from head to toes
We won't budge, for no one
Rebels

Ridin', yeah
Straight to the top, there's no gettin' by it, uh
Ashes like fireworks in the sky, yeah, uh
Don't be afraid of heights 'cause we flyin'
Hear the sirens?
(Quiet, shh)

Everything is burning and I love it
Sit and watch the world until it's nothin'
Scared of goin' out into the public, yeah
We the kings now
Take it if you can't afford to cop it
Talk about a baller on a budget
Gloomy till they put me in a coffin, yeah
Let us sing now

Raise some hell before we ghost
Break the rules, a broken nose
You know us, we're soldiers
Rips and holes in baggy clothes
Drippy heart from head to toes
We won't budge, for no one
