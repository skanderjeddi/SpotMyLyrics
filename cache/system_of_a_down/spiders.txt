The piercing radiant moon (The piercing radiant moon)
The storming of poor June (Storming of poor June)
All the life running through her hair (Through her hair)

Approaching guiding light (Approaching guiding light)
Our shallow years in fright (Our shallow years in fright)
Dreams are made, winding (Dreams are made, winding)
Through my head (Through my head)
Through my head

Before you know, awake

Your lives are open wide
The V-chip gives them sight
Of all the life running through her hair

The spiders all in tune
The evening of the moon
Dreams are made, winding
Through my head
Through my head

Before you know, awake

Through my head
Through my head
Before you know

Before you know I will be waiting, all awake

Dreams are made winding through her hair
Dreams are made winding through her hair
