Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
All romantic
(Eyes blue like the Atlantic and I'm going down like the Titanic)

Stay hungry
Stay foolish
Is their farewell message as they signed off
Stay hungry
Stay foolish

Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
