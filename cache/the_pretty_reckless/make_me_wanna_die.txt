Take me I'm alive
Never was a girl with a wicked mind
But everything looks better when the sun goes down

I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night

Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes your eyes
You make me wanna die

I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love
Will burn up in the light
And every time I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die

Taste me, drink my soul
Show me all the things that I shouldn't know
When there's a blue moon on the rise

I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night

Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes your eyes
Everything in your eyes, your eyes
You make me wanna die

I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love
Will burn up in the light
And every time I look inside your eyes
(burning in the light)
You make me wanna die

I would die for you my love, my love
I would lie for you my love, my love
(you make me wanna die)
I would steal for you, my love, my love
(you make me wanna die)
I would die for you my love, my love
We'll burn up in the light

And every time I look inside your eyes
I'm burning in the light
Look inside your eyes
I'm burning in the light
I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die
