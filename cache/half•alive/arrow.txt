Life begins to happen
When I plan somethin' else
Tryna be somebody
But all I got was someone else

My plans always changin'
Always rearrangin', oh
Slow it down, release control
Slow and steady, let me know

Life begins to happen
When I plan somethin' else
Tryna be somebody
But all I got was someone else

But my plans always changin'
Always rearrangin', oh
Slow it down, release control
Slow and steady, let me know

The hardest place to be
Is right where you are
In the space between
The finish and the start
It's the arrow in your heart
The arrow in your heart

Now I'm restless
Runnin' from the present
I, I know my mind's been cheatin'
Thinkin' that I will arrive

But my plans always changin'
Always rearrangin', oh
Slow it down, release control
Slow and steady, let me know

The hardest place to be
Is right where you are
In the space between
The finish and the start
It's the arrow in your heart
The arrow in your heart
The arrow in your heart
The arrow in your heart

Run fast, I'll end up exhausted
Out of breath, thinkin' where I went wrong
This heart is afraid to beat slowly
Miss a chance at what I could become
I know that I can't run forever
But I can't stand still for too long
This heart is afraid to beat slowly

The hardest place to be
Is right where you are
In the space between
The finish and the start
It's the arrow in your heart
The arrow in your heart
