You had your own Pete Wentz and Patrick combined
Writing you songs and singing them all like
Every single day
Tour brings that special pain

So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe but not in you and me, so
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe but not in you and me, so

I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent

You had your own Awsten Knight (Hi)
He texted back fast and he made you laugh yeah
Yeah you must be out of your mind
Well, I know you are. Let's see, where to start?
How about the messages that you still send
Even though I blocked your number and I never fucking answer
My anxiety was turbulent and permanent
You gave me hell on Earth and said to 'work with it'

So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe but not in you and me, so
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe but not in you and me, so

I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent

You had a taste of the life
But you grew complacent and my sanity laced itself
Up in the back of your mind
And that's where you left me to die
