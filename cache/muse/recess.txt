Resuscitate
In my sleep
Awake to see
You're never here

But the losing yields
Another year
Facing hopes and fears

And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life

And the planes and trains
Are to blame
For tempting us
To refrain
And to cut the chord
Dis every word
Of the truths absurd

And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life

Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
And you've kissed my life
