You needed it when I was away
And no matter what I say
You'll never forget when I wasn't there so
Why should I care?
I'm young but I know that I'm aroused

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there

It doesn't matter where I have gone
I just can't afford to
Pay for all the mistakes that you have made
It's about time I was paid

I'm young but I know that I'm aroused

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there

You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
