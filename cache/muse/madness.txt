(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you mean

Ooh oh oh

And now I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you need

Mmmm

(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care (expecting you to care)
But I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
I have finally realized (realized)
I need your love
I need your love

Come to me
Just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know, I can't be wrong
And baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)
