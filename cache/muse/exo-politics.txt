Open the skies over me
I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for a sign

As conspiracies unwind
Will you slam shut
Or free your mind
Or stay hypnotized

When the Zetas fill the skies
Will our leaders tell us why
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for the sign

Carried through the centuries
Secrets locked up
And loaded on my back
And it weighs me down

When the Zetas fill the skies
It's just our leaders in disguise
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

I am waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign, yeah
And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign
