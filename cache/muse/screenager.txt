Who's so phoney and always surrounded?
Stop your screaming, no one can hear
All the scars on your skin: 'Post no bills'

Who you were
Was so beautiful
Remember who, who you were

Hide from the mirror, the cracks and the memories
Hide from your family, they won't know you now
For all the holes in our souls host no thrills

Who you were
Was so beautiful
Memories who, who you were
