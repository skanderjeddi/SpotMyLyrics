What we have's the only thing worth fighting for
And I, I won't let nothing keep us apart
Through these fallouts there is
A truth and pain but through it all
You will always have my heart

I see a change on the horizon
Reasons to be frightened
I know that we can pull through
I am here to tell you

Get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do this thing without you
I'm lost in this without you
Get up and fight
We've gotta get up and fight
I can't handle this without you
Can't do it without you

In our heads, a million voices scream and shout
And no one will ever hear a sound
Oh, only you can hush it
And calm the turmoil and the noise
And help me reach the higher ground

I see a change on the horizon
Reasons to be frightened
There's nothing we can't get through
I am here to tell you

To get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do this thing without you
I'm lost in this without you
Get up and fight
We've gotta get up and fight
I can't handle this without you
Can't do it without you

Get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do it without you

Get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do this thing without you
I'm lost in this without you
Get up and fight
We've gotta get up and fight
I can't handle this without you
Can't do it without you

I can't survive without your love in my life
You've gotta get up and fight
