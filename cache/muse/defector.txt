Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

You think you're strong and you can't be broken
But your empire is dissolving
You thought, you thought I was weak
But you got it wrong
Look into my eyes
I'm a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

Your blood is blue and your mind is turned green
And your belly is all yellow
You believe your throne is too high to be overthrown
We'll watch it get razed
By a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

I'm a defector
Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector
