Help me
I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game
I tried to infiltrate
But now I'm losing men in cloaks
Always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows
Before they eat my soul

Mercy, mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under hypnotised
By another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks
Always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows
The world just disavows

Mercy, mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me

Show me mercy
Show me mercy please

Help me
I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks
Trying to devour my soul

Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
From the gutless and mean
Show me mercy
From the killing machines
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me
