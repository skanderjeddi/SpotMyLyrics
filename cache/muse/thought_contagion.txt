Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
Brain cleansed fractured identity
Fragments and scattered debris

Thought contagion
Thought contagion

Fall down learn when to count it out
Prop me up before I black out
Withdraw before you're out of time
A clean slate and buried war crimes

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs

Thought contagion
Thought contagion

They'll never do what you want them to
Give it up and watch them break through
It's too late for a revolution
Brace for the final solution

Thought contagion

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs

Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
It's too late for a revolution
