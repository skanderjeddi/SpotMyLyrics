It's happening soon
It's happening soon
It's scent has been blowing in my direction
To me it is new
To me it is new
And it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

It's got to be here
It's got to be there
It's got to be now
Or I'll lose forever

To me it is strange
This feeling is strange
But it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

Accuse me
Trust me
I never knew
That you were the one
You were the one
Oh

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you
