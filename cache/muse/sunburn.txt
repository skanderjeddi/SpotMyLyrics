Come waste your millions here
Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow

She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons make no mistake

Come let the truth be shared
No-one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cries

She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons make no mistake

And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll burn forever
I can't face the shame

And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll burn forever
I can't face the shame
