I've exposed your lies, baby 
The underneath's no big surprise
Now it's time for changing 
And cleansing everything 
To forget your love

My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
Is tired of living

Don't confuse 
Baby you're gonna lose 
Your own game 
Change me 
Replace the envying 
To forget your love

My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
Is tired of living
And I've seen your loving 
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
