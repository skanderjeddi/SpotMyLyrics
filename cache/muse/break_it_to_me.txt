(Break it to me)
(Break it to me)
(Break it to me)

Don't dress it up but don't beat around the bush
And don't cover it up but don't push it underground
And don't keep it inside and don't edit and redact
And no dumbing it down
And don't fake it, just

(Break it to me)
(Break it to me)
(Break it to me)

And I can handle the truth
I can cope with whatever you're holding back
No need to sugar coat
Just
(Don't dress it up but don't beat around the bush
And don't cover it up but don't push it underground
And don't keep it inside and don't edit and redact
And no dumbing it down
And don't fake it, just)

(Break it to me)
(Break it to me)
(Just break it to me)

I know how to mend
I can rise high above the ashes
I'll re-invent
I will re-emerge
Reborn

(Break it to me)
(Break it to me)
