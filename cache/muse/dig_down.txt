When hope and love has been lost
And you fall to the ground
You must find a way
When the darkness descends
And you're told it's the end
You must find a way
When God decides to look the other way
And a clown takes the throne
We must find a way
Face the firing squad
Against all the odds
You will find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down
And find faith
When you're close to the edge
With a gun to your head
You must find a way

When friends are thin on the ground
And they try to divide us
We must find a way
We have entered the fray
And we will not obey
We must find a way
Yeah

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down
And find faith
When they've left you for dead
(Dig down)
And you can only see red
(Dig down)
You must find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down
Find faith
We won't let them divide
(Dig down)
We will never abide
(Dig down)
We will find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down
Faith
Dig down
Dig down
Faith
