Too late 
Yeah baby it's too late
And time has made the spell abate
And now it's time to desecrate

But we had a dream
And it was meant to be
And we were kissing gods
Against all the odds

Now it's a crying shame
And it's a crying shame
You don't know who to blame
We'll never be the same
And it's a crying shame

Too much
And we demolished too much
And yeah we really fucked it up
And yeah baby you've lost your touch

But we had a dream
And it was meant to be
And we were kissing gods
Against all the odds

Now it's a crying shame
And it's a crying shame
You don't know who to blame
We'll never be the same
And it's a crying shame
And it's a crying shame
