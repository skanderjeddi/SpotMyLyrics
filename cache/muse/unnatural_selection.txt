They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth

I'm hungry for some unrest
I want to push this beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that they'll understand

Dedication to a new age
Is this the end of destruction and rampage?
Another chance to erase then repeat it again

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No (Hey) chance (Hey) for fate (Hey)
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth

No religion or mind virus
Is there a hope that the facts will ever find us?
Just make sure that you're are looking out for number one

I'm hungry for some unrest
Let's push this beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that you will understand

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us crawl
The lucky don't share at all
No (Hey) hope (Hey) for fate (Hey)
It's a random chance selection
I want the truth

Try to ride out the storm
Whilst they'll make you believe
They are the special ones (We have not been chosen)

Injustice is the norm
You won't be the first
And you know you won't be the last

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean, ocean, ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us fall
And the lucky they don't care at all
No (Hey) chance (Hey) for fate (Hey)
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth, I want the truth
I want the truth, I want the truth
