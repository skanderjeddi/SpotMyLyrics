Lotta money, I could have a cash war
Flew back across the water with a passport
Lamborghini Urus, it's fast forward
I been 'round the world, securin' me that bag, boy
Call the bros and they be like it next door
Rolls Royce got carpet in the floor, boy
Hunnid thousand dollars on all the toys
Most stylish people calling me the Drip Lord
Keep it hardcore, pop a Addy while I work, meet Tom Ford
It's so real, thug niggas 'round me, these niggas I'd kill for
We stood tough, we ain't zagged, we ain't switched-up, we the same us
One of the real ones and I ain't changed up
White Range Rover with the beige guts

Can't save her, I'ma kick her out after I slay her
Nigga got sauce, I got flavor
In Saks Fifth holdin' drip that I paid for
New crib got a lotta acres
The way you suck, you can get an A+
Bitch, you fake, you can get your brains bust
Get a check and go and get your chain bust
Get a check and go and get your chain bust
Got Elliante, yeah, some real rocks
Blue-colored diamonds on your wrist
And for three or four, you can get a plain watch
Spent twenty thousand on a plain watch
Rose gold Richard Mille, what you ain't got
Pop a pussy nigga, leave him shell-shocked
I'm a big dripper, wear Chanel socks

Lotta money, I could have a cash war
Flew back across the water with a passport
Lamborghini Urus, it's fast forward
I been 'round the world, securin' me that bag, boy
Call the bros and they be like it next door
Rolls Royce got carpet in the floor, boy
Hunnid thousand dollars on all the toys
Most stylish people calling me the Drip Lord
Keep it hardcore, pop a Addy while I work, meet Tom Ford
It's so real, thug niggas 'round me, these niggas I'd kill for
We stood tough, we ain't zagged, we ain't switched-up, we the same us
One of the real ones and I ain't changed up
White Range Rover with the beige guts

White Range Rover with the beige guts
Got a table, had to pay, it's paper
She wax that pussy, she don't use a razor
Diggin' in it like I'm tryna dig a grave up
I'm the one they asking for a favor
Swear to God that it wasn't your favor
Stack a lotta cash, I got layers
I've been ballin' in L.A., feel like a Laker
I don't let my nigga get a pay cut
Want a milli? Come and slime with the makers
Red-and-black Bentley like a Raider
Bring it to your front door like a cater
Tough man, I'm a alligator
When I buy it I get shit tailored
Total displace, whoever tryna play us
And I glisten now, a nigga feelin' way up

Lotta money, I could have a cash war
Flew back across the water with a passport
Lamborghini Urus, it's fast forward
I been 'round the world, securin' me that bag, boy
Call the bros and they be like it next door
Rolls Royce got carpet in the floor, boy
Hunnid thousand dollars on all the toys
Most stylish people calling me the Drip Lord
Keep it hardcore, pop a Addy while I work, meet Tom Ford
It's so real, thug niggas 'round me, these niggas I'd kill for
We stood tough, we ain't zagged, we ain't switched-up, we the same us
