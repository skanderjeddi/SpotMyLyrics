(Wheezy outta here)

Who you think you're foolin'?
We got new toolies 
We kinda fluent
I'm scammin' that work
I come from the mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma get out my problems, above 'em
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

We don't need no one vouchin' for us
I been grindin' here, found me a buzz
I been searchin' for love and found lust
It's so hard to stop holdin' a grudge
'm on that dance, bitch, I shoot like I dance
My old squad kept the kid in the cut
Keep your strap, 'cause these niggas play tough
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Keep it real, there's a lotta fake love
Niggas hate, but they bitches in love
And the Bentleyall white like a dove
I took off, ate this Xan, means it works
Pay that out or I won't do the verse
I want someone who can tell when it hurt
You can't tell me she ain't a slut

Who you think you're foolin'?
We got new toolies 
We kinda fluent
I'm scammin' that work
I come from the mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma get out my problems, above 'em
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

I don't need no one vouchin' for me
I be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth
Car push-start, I keep losin' them keys
Chanel boss, my closet full of C's
My shit wet, Elliante VV's
I got pearls on my neck now, no beads
I get cash in my bank when I'm asleep
New blue-face, two-tone Patek Philippe
Beverly Center, shopping spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't no one of my foreigns on lease
All my bitches got expensive weaves
I still strive for my plan to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off that top for a breeze

Who you think you're foolin'?
We got new toolies 
We kinda fluent
I'm scammin' that work
I come from the mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma get out my problems, above 'em
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love
