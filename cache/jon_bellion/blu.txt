Messing with my pride, thinking anytime
You could just get up and go
Then I realize what the hell is love
If you're in complete control?

Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Sucked up by the wave, shot to outer space
Stranded, but I'm not alone

Fall into your blu
Fall into your blu
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blu

Sunrise in your bed, purple, yellow, red
Only when it's you and me
Take me to the edge, drag me through your lens
Show me what I need to see

Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Avenues and lanes, parachutes and planes
Push me out, away we go

Fall into your blu
Fall into your blu
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blu

Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
(Come to my house and take me home)
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
(Come to my house and take me home)

Fall into your blu
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fall into your blu
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blu
