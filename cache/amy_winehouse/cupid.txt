Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me

I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all my happiness
For I love a man who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

So Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me

Now, if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love him 'til eternity
I know that 'tween the both of us his heart we can steal
You can help me if you will

So, Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me

Cupid
Cupid
I love him love him
