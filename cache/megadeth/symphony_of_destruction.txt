You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a-roll
A-roll, A-roll

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, Explodes

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Just like thee Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

[Solo - Friedman:]

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A-warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
A-tall, A-tall

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction
